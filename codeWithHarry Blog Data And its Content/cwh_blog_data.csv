After going through the comments of my videos, I found there are several students who have not purchased a laptop and they’re in search of a good laptop, but confused, because there are tons of options available. Don’t worry I got you covered!
In this post, we’ll be discussing top laptops for the people whose budget is around 40-70k.
There are certain points that I want to make very clear,
Firstly all the laptops contain RTX 3000 series GPU because this is the latest GPU and it has some mind-boggling features such as DLSS, Reflex, etc., and this series is based on Ampere Architecture.
Secondly, we’ve picked some laptops that don’t contain the latest Gen processor but believe me the performance of those CPUs is much better than the latest ones.
1. HP Pavilion Ryzen 5600H, GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop:
This is the laptop that has driven me crazy because after looking at the specs and the price I was totally amazed. This laptop comes with Ryzen 5 5600H processor that contains 6 cores, and 12 threads. It has RTX 3050 in it and on top of that, you’ll fall in love with the design of this laptop because it looks really premium and classy laptop.
Pros
It has a 15.6inch FHD Display with 144Hz and 300 nits.
It comes with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth version 5.2.
It has 2 slots for RAM which means you can upgrade your RAM to 32 Gigabytes.
It also has an HDD slot, you can put SATA HDD or SSD in that slot, and can increase the storage of the laptop.
Cons
Battery backup is average
No Fingerprint
Only 2 USB Port
Link: HP Pavilion 
2. Lenovo Ideapad Gaming Ryzen 5 5600H, RTX 3050 Laptop:
This laptop comes with Ryzen 5 5600H (6 cores, 12 threads) processor, and it also has the same GPU i.e. RTX 3050. It has 8GB RAM, and you can upgrade the RAM as it comes with one empty slot. The screen size of this laptop is 15.6 inches with 120 Hz.

3. MSI GF63 Thin Core i5 10th Gen Laptop:
This laptop is a hot pick for those whose budget is around 65k and who want to experience the RTX 3050 GPU. The only con of this laptop is its Generation, as it comes with 10th gen, but wait guys, lemme tell you the truth. If your budget is tight and you really want a great laptop, then you can go with it.
It has a 10th gen core i5 processor (6 cores and 12 threads). It has RTX 3050 GPU with 4GB VRAM. The display of this laptop is 15.6 inches with 144 Hz.

Though the gen is 4th and not the latest one, still it defeats most of the 5th gen processors, if you want my simple answer then yes it is better than Ryzen 5 5600H processor. If these generations don’t matter to you, then you can buy this laptop without thinking twice.

Should You Upgrade To Windows 11 Just Yet? + Installation of Windows 11,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/windows-11-update-installation/,"Hello folks, recently Microsoft rolled out its new Windows 11 on 5 October. If you don’t know about the features of Windows 11, then you can check out this blog. So, this blog is solely for those who want to upgrade to windows 11 and are confused about whether they should update or not?
Despite being the latest version of Windows, I don’t think you should upgrade to Windows 11 right now. Windows 11 has been optimized for good productivity and also packs with a Good UI design, but it is too early to migrate. I mean in probably 3-4 months I might upgrade, but not now. Why? Because  I personally think there’s not much to explore in windows 11 right now. The most hyped feature, the support for android apps in windows, for which I was excited about the most, got delayed, and also, there are reports coming that the final release has some performance issues. I heard some news where a user said:
“A Dell XPS 13 just felt slower, despite its 10th-generation Intel processor and 8 gigabytes of RAM. Even when I closed Slack, which was eating RAM like a hungry hippo, the computer still wasn’t as peppy as it was on Windows 10. If your older computer is still running smoothly on Windows 10, you might think twice before upgrading!”
If you still dare to upgrade to Windows 11, then here’s the official method to do so.
Steps to install Windows 11 (without losing any data)
1. Navigate to this site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows11
2. Now click on download installation assistant.
3. Now open the assistant and click on agree to start the installation.
NOTE:  YOU MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET SO THE INSTALLER CAN DOWNLOAD THE FILES
4. This is how it will look while downloading
5. It will take a while, remember if you are on Laptop, make sure to plug in the charger. 
6. Once the files are downloaded and installed it will look like this.
7. Now your pc will look something like this which means we are almost there,
And once it is done you will be greeted with Windows 11 Lock screen,
  That’s all for this tutorial. Hope you will successfully upgrade to Windows 11. If you still have any doubt, then feel free to comment below. Thank you everyone and I’ll catch you in the next tutorial.

PC Builds for Coders - Budget PCs You Can Build This Festive Season,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/pc-builds-for-coders-2021/,"Hello everyone, in this blog, we will build three pc under the budget of 30k rupees. 
We are going for custom build this time just because prebuilds are not good and there you don’t have the option to choose the components and sometimes the performance of those components are poor. Also, prebuild components don’t offer you many upgradability options. In terms of custom builds, we have the independence to choose components and we also have better upgradability options. And we can build the pc at an affordable price. 
Here I’ve mentioned different builds:
  20000 INR BUILD
For the 20k build, we are going with this configuration
Processor - AMD Athlon 3000G
Motherboard - Gigabyte AMD A320
RAM - Corsair Vengeance 8 GB DDR4
Storage - Seagate 1TB 
Cabinet - Frontech Semi-Premium Full ATX
Total Price: 19038
  25000 INR BUILD
For the 25k build, we are going with this configuration.
Processor - Core i3 10100
Motherboard - MSI H510M-A PRO
RAM - Corsair Vengeance 8 GB DDR4
Storage - Seagate 1TB 
Cabinet - Frontech Semi-Premium Full ATX
Total Price: 27750
  30000 INR BUILD
For the 30k build, we are going with this configuration.
Processor - Ryzen 3 3200G
Motherboard - ASRock A320M
RAM - Corsair Vengeance 8 GB DDR4
Storage - Seagate 1TB 
Cabinet - Frontech Semi-Premium Full ATX
Total Price: 26750
  Due to the high prices of PC components at this time, these are the best I could gather. Maybe the prices will get low in the future, and these builds will become cheaper than they are right now. I have chosen iGPU for the intel build, and APU’s for AMD builds as dedicated graphics card prices are much higher. If you plan on gaming somewhere near the future, you can add a graphic card to the build. 
I have prepared a google sheet with links, you can access it by using the links given below.

[October 2021] Best Laptop Models to Buy For College Students,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/best-laptop-models-to-buy-2021/,"In this blog, we will be discussing the best laptop models to buy for students. Before buying any laptop you should consider these points first. 
Importance of SSD: 
You should always prefer a laptop with SSD. SSDs are 10X faster than mechanical hard drives and are highly recommended these days. SSDs usually have a longer life compared to mechanical drives.
Importance of Recent Processors: 
The processor is responsible for processing the data. Better the processor better computations can be performed by it. More threads and cores mean better multitasking(multiprocessing). Higher-generation processors are usually better in terms of performance and pricing.
How to get Discounts?
You can get very good deals during Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale and Amazon’s Great Indian Festival Sale. 
How much Ram is sufficient?
RAM is responsible for storing the programs temporarily in the volatile memory. The higher and faster the RAM, the better the multitasking performance. For an average user I suggest 8 GB of ram is enough. 
Do you need a Graphics Card?
If you are interested in gaming, video editing, or graphics-intensive software like Blender, Premiere Pro/After-Effects, you will need a good graphic card. Otherwise, graphic cards will not hamper your experience on your machine.
Best Laptop Models To Buy [October 2021]
Here I am providing the link to an Excel sheet where you can find the best laptop models which I have shortlisted. You can try these links below.

Django Cheatsheet,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/django-cheatsheet/,"What is Django?
Python-based web framework used for rapid development of web applications.
Installing Django + Setup
pip install django
Creating a project
The below command creates a new project named projectName
django-admin startproject projectName
Starting a server
The below command starts the development server.
python manage.py runserver
Django MVT
Django follows MVT(Model, View, Template) architecture.
Sample Django Model
The model represents the schema of the database.
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model): # Product is the name of our model
    product_id=models.AutoField
Sample views.py
View decides what data gets delivered to the template.
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse(""Django CodeWithHarry Cheatsheet"")
Sample HTML Template
A sample .html file that contains HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
    <meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""ie=edge"">
    <title>CodeWithHarry Cheatsheet</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a sample template file.</h1>
</body>
</html>
Views in Django
Sample Function-Based Views
A python function that takes a web request and returns a web response.
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse(""This is a function based view."")
Sample Class-Based Views
Django's class-based views provide an object-oriented way of organizing your view code.
from django.views import View

class SimpleClassBasedView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        pass # Code to process a GET request
URLs in Django
Set of URL patterns to be matched against the requested URL.
Sample urls.py file1

    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
]
Sample urls.py file2
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # ... snip ...
    path('community/', include('aggregator.urls')),
    path('contact/', include('contact.urls')),
    # ... snip ...
]
Forms in Django
Similar to HTML forms but are created by Django using the form field.
Sample Django form
from django import forms

# creating a form
class SampleForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    description = forms.CharField()
Apps in Django
Apps in Django are like independent modules for different functionalities.
Creating an app
python manage.py startapp AppName
Listing app in the settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',

        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            # some options here
        },
    },
]
Changing the views.py file
A view is associated with every URL. This view is responsible for displaying the content from the template.
def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html') #render is used to return the template
Sample template file
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to perform operations based on some condition.
If Statement
if statement checks the condition and if it is True, then the block of if statement executes; otherwise, control skips that block of code.
if (condition) { 
// code to execute if condition is met 
}
If..Else
if the condition of if block evaluates to True, then if block executes otherwise else block executes
if (condition) { 
// code to execute if condition is met 
} else { 
// code to execute if condition is not met 
}
If..Elseif..Else
It executes different codes for more than two conditions
if (condition) { 
// code to execute if condition is met 
} elseif (condition) { 
// code to execute if this condition is met 
} else { 
// code to execute if none of the conditions are met 
}
Switch Statement
It allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases).
switch (n) { 
case x: 
code to execute if n=x; 
break; 
case y: 
code to execute if n=y; 
break; 
case z: 
code to execute if n=z; 
break; 
// add more cases as needed 
default: 
code to execute if n is neither of the above; 
}
Loops
Iterative statements or Loops facilitate programmers to execute any block of code lines repeatedly.
For Loop
It is used to iterate the statements several times. It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like the array and linked list.
for (starting counter value; ending counter value; increment by which 
to increase) { 
// code to execute goes here 
}
Foreach Loop
The foreach loop loops through a block of code for each element in an array.
foreach ($InsertYourArrayName as $value) { 
// code to execute goes here 
}
While Loop
It iterate the block of code as long as a specified condition is True or vice versa
while (condition that must apply) { 
// code to execute goes here 
}
Do-While Loop
This loop is very similar to the while loop with one difference, i.e., the body of the do-while loop is executed at least once even if the condition is False. It is an exit-controlled loop.
do { 
// code to execute goes here; 
} while (condition that must apply);

Everything About Pegasus Spyware,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/pegasus-spyware-2021/,"What is Pegasus?
Pegasus is a spyware developed by the Israeli cyber arms firm NSO Group that can be installed on mobile phones running iOS, Android & Blackberry. Pegasus is capable of reading text messages, tracking calls, collecting passwords, location tracking, accessing the target device's microphone and camera, and harvesting information from apps. This is a Trojan horse that can be sent ""flying through the air"" to infect phones.
How Pegasus Infects:
Pegasus uses Zero Click Attack. The older version of the spyware(2016-2018) used the SPEAR PHISHING technique to get into a device. Spear Phishing is a phishing technique where you click on one link and it installs the software on your device. But now, it can reach other phones using ZERO-CLICK-ATTACK which is as scary as it sounds. In Zero-Click-Attack, the spyware exploits a vulnerability of one of the apps presented on the phone without any interaction on your side, and then it spreads itself to the other device without the users’ knowledge.
TRIDENT Vulnerability in 2016:
In 2016 a security analysis shows that the malware exploits three zero-day vulnerabilities, Trident, in Apple’s iOS:
CVE-2016-4657: Memory Corruption in WebKit - A vulnerability in Safari WebKit allows the attacker to compromise the device when the user clicks on a link.
CVE-2016-4655: Kernel Information Leak - A kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the attacker that allows him to calculate the kernel’s location in memory.
CVE-2016-4656: Kernel Memory corruption leads to Jailbreak - 32 and 64-bit iOS kernel-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software.
These vulnerabilities were present in the versions of iOS up to iOS 9.3.4. Given the severity of Trident, Apple worked extremely quickly to patch these vulnerabilities and has released iOS 9.3.5 to address them. 
Whatsapp Call Vulnerability in 2019:
In 2019 WhatsApp revealed that NSO’s software had been used to send malware to more than 1,400 phones by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability. Simply by placing a WhatsApp call to a target device, malicious Pegasus code could be installed on the phone, even if the target never answered the call.
Now the Security Issue has been fixed by Facebook the parent company of Whatsapp. 
https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2019-3568
What does Pegasus do after getting inside your phone?
Once the spyware gets to the phone it can gain root access easily and pretty much do anything. Like it can look into your photos, videos, call logs, all the information stored in the device. And the scariest part is, it can start your camera and microphone anytime. It can also read your keystrokes. So if you are typing your password, then the spyware can read it too. It hooks into widely used secure messenger applications to copy cleartext data out of them before the user’s app can encrypt and send it. From the perspective of the user and the people they’re communicating with, their communications are secure, while the administrator of the Pegasus instance has secretly intercepted the clear text of their communication.
What to do?
If you are just a normal person, then I think you are safe from it because right now only some high profile people are being targeted. It does not mean that we can take this lightly. The spyware violates several Indian IT Rules and the government is taking strict action against it. 
Where can I download it?
I have seen people googling ""pegasus apk download"". It does not work like that. You will have to buy one license for it. Pegasus carries a high price tag averaging at over $25,000 per target. And the process is highly complicated for a normal person to buy. So, if you see pegasus.apk on the internet there is a 100% chance that it is fake. 
The Conclusion:
As of now several thousands of people are infected worldwide by this spyware. How many and which “Zero Day Exploits” does pegasus use to infect is still unknown to us. Right now all we can say is that if you are not in connection with any high-profile people who have recently been infected then you are probably safe."

Decision Making Instructions
Conditional statements are used to perform operations based on some condition.
If Statement
if (condition) {
// This block of code will get executed, if the condition is True
}
If-else Statement
if (condition) {
// If condition is True then this block will get executed
} else {
// If condition is False then this block will get executed
}
if else-if Statement
if (condition) {
// Statements;
}
else if (condition){
// Statements;
}
else{
// Statements
}
Ternary Operator
It is shorthand of an if-else statement.
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
Switch Case Statement
It allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases).
switch (expression) 
{
case constant-expression: 
statement1;
statement2;
break;
case constant-expression: 
statement;
break;
...
default: 
statement;
}
Iterative Statements
Iterative statements facilitate programmers to execute any block of code lines repeatedly and can be controlled as per conditions added by the programmer.
while Loop
It iterates the block of code as long as a specified condition is True
while (/* condition */)
{
/* code block to be executed */
}
do-while loop
It is an exit controlled loop. It is very similar to the while loop with one difference, i.e., the body of the do-while loop is executed at least once even if the condition is False
do
{
/* code */
} while (/* condition */);
for loop
It is used to iterate the statements or a part of the program several times. It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like the array and linked list.
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
/* code */
}
Break Statement
break keyword inside the loop is used to terminate the loop
break;
Continue Statement
continue keyword skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and returns to the starting point of the loop
continue;
References
Reference is an alias for an already existing variable. Once it is initialized to a variable, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable. So, it's a const pointer.
Creating References
string var1 = ""Value1""; // var1 variable
string &var2 = var1; // reference to var1
Pointers
Pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable
Declaration
datatype *var_name; 

var_name = &variable2;
Functions & Recursion
Functions are used to divide an extensive program into smaller pieces. It can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.
Function Definition
return_type function_name(data_type parameter...){ 
//code to be executed 
}
Function Call
function_name(arguments);
Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a minor problem. And the function that calls itself is known as the Recursive function.
void recurse()
{
... .. ...
recurse();
... .. ...
}
Object-Oriented Programming
It is a programming approach that primarily focuses on using objects and classes. The objects can be any real-world entities.
class
class Class_name {
public: // Access specifier
// fields
// functions
// blocks
};
object
Class_name ObjectName;
Constructors
It is a special method that is called automatically as soon as the object is created.
class className { // The class
public: // Access specifier
className() { // Constructor
cout << ""Code With Harry"";
}
};

int main() {
className obj_name; 
return 0;
}
Encapsulation
Data encapsulation is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and data abstraction is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class ExampleEncap{ 
private: 
/* Since we have marked these data members private, 
* any entity outside this class cannot access these 
* data members directly, they have to use getter and 
* setter functions. 
*/ 
int num; 
char ch; 
public: 
/* Getter functions to get the value of data members. 
* Since these functions are public, they can be accessed 
* outside the class, thus provide the access to data members 
* through them 
*/ 
int getNum() const { 
return num; 
} 
char getCh() const { 
return ch; 
} 
/* Setter functions, they are called for assigning the values 
* to the private data members. 
*/ 
void setNum(int num) { 
this->num = num; 
} 
void setCh(char ch) { 
this->ch = ch; 
} 
}; 
int main(){ 
ExampleEncap obj; 
obj.setNum(100); 
obj.setCh('A'); 
cout<<obj.getNum()<<endl; 
cout<<obj.getCh()<<endl; 
return 0; 
}
File Handling
File handling refers to reading or writing data from files. C provides some functions that allow us to manipulate data in the files.
Creating and writing to a text file
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
// Create and open a text file
ofstream MyFile(""filename.txt"");

// Write to the file
MyFile << ""File Handling in C++"";

// Close the file
MyFile.close();
}
Reading the file
It allows us to read the file line by line
getline()
Opening a File
It opens a file in the C++ program
void open(const char* file_name,ios::openmode mode);
OPEN MODES
in
Opens the file to read(default for ifstream)
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::in)
out
Opens the file to write(default for ofstream)
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::out)
binary
Opens the file in binary mode
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::binary)
app
Opens the file and appends all the outputs at the end
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::app)
ate
Opens the file and moves the control to the end of the file
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::ate)
trunc
Removes the data in the existing file
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::trunc)
nocreate
Opens the file only if it already exists
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::nocreate)
noreplace
Opens the file only if it does not already exist
fs.open (""test.txt"", std::fstream::noreplace)
Closing a file
It closes the file
myfile.close()
Exception Handling
An exception is an unusual condition that results in an interruption in the flow of the program.
try and catch block
A basic try-catch block in python. When the try block throws an error, the control goes to the except block
try {
// code to try
throw exception; // If a problem arises, then throw an exception
}
catch () {
// Block of code to handle errors
}

Basic syntax and functions from the Java programming language.
Boilerplate
class HelloWorld{ 
public static void main(String args[]){ 
System.out.println(""Hello World""); 
} 
}
Showing Output
It will print something to the output console.
System.out.println([text])
Taking Input
It will take string input from the user
import java.util.Scanner; //import scanner class

// create an object of Scanner class
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

Primitive Type Variables
The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, and char those aren't considered objects and represent raw values.
byte
byte is a primitive data type it only takes up 8 bits of memory.
age = 18;
long
long is another primitive data type related to integers. long takes up 64 bits of memory.
viewsCount = 3_123_456L;
float
We represent basic fractional numbers in Java using the float type. This is a single-precision decimal number. Which means if we get past six decimal points, this number becomes less precise and more of an estimate.
price = 100INR;
char
Char is a 16-bit integer representing a Unicode-encoded character.
letter = 'A';
boolean
The simplest primitive data type is boolean. It can contain only two values: true or false. It stores its value in a single bit.
isEligible = true;
int
int holds a wide range of non-fractional number values.
var1 = 256;
short
If we want to save memory and byte is too small, we can use short.
short var2 = 786;

}
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data and code acting on the data together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
public class Person { 
private String name; // using private access modifier

public String getName() { 
return name; 
} 

// Setter 
public void setName(String newName) {

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name 
{ 
//methods and fields 
}
Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
// A class with multiple methods with the same name 
public class Adder { 
// method 1 
public void add(int a, int b) { 
System.out.println(a + b); 
} 

// method 2 
public void add(int a, int b, int c) { 
System.out.println(a + b + c);

// method 3 
public void add(String a, String b) { 
System.out.println(a + "" + "" + b); 
} 
} 

// My main class 
class MyMainClass { 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
Adder adder = new Adder(); // create a Adder object 
adder.add(5, 4); // invoke method 1 
adder.add(5, 4, 3); // invoke method 2

The function return statement return the specified value or data item to the caller. If we do not want to return any value simply place a void before function name while defining it.
return_type function_name()
{
return value;
}
Parameters in python function
Parameters are the values passed inside the parenthesis of the function while defining as well as while calling.
return_type function_name(data_type parameter...){     //defining the functions with parameters
//code to be executed 
}
function_name(parameter...);             //calling the functions with parameters

Basic syntax from the python programming language
Showing Output To User
The print function is used to display or print output as follows
print(""Content that you wanna print on screen"")
we can display the content present in object using prit function as follows:-
var1 = ""Shruti""
print(""Hi my name is: "",var1)
Taking Input From the User
The input function is used to take input as string or character from the user as follows:
var1 = input(""Enter your name: "")
print(""My name is: "", var1)
To take input in form of other datatypes we need to typecaste them as follows:-
To take input as an integer:-
var1=int(input(""enter the integer value""))
print(var1)
To take input as an float:-
var1=float(input(""enter the float value""))
print(var1)
range Function
range function returns a sequence of numbers, eg, numbers starting from 0 to n-1 for range(0, n)
range(int_start_value,int_stop_value,int_step_value)
Here the start value and step value are by default 1 if not mentioned by the programmer. but int_stop_value is the compulsory parameter in range function
example-
Display all even numbers between 1 to 100
for i in range(0,101,2):
       print(i)
Comments
Comments are used to make the code more understandable for programmers, and they are not executed by compiler or interpreter.
Single line comment
# This is a single line comment
Multi-line comment
'''This is a
multi-line
comment'''
Escape Sequence
An escape sequence is a sequence of characters; it doesn't represent itself (but is translated into another character) when used inside string literal or character. Some of the escape sequence characters are as follows:
Newline
Newline Character
print(""\n"")
Backslash
It adds a backslash
print(""\\"")
Single Quote
It adds a single quotation mark
print(""\'"")
Tab
It gives a tab space
print(""\t"")
Backspace
It adds a backspace
print(""\b"")
Octal value
It represents the value of an octal number
print(""\ooo"")
Hex value
It represents the value of a hex number
print(""\xhh"")
Carriage Return
Carriage return or \r will just work as you have shifted your cursor to the beginning of the string or line.
pint(""\r"")
Strings
Python string is a sequence of characters, and each character can be individually accessed using its index.
String
You can create Strings by enclosing text in both forms of quotes - single quotes or double quotes.
variable_name = ""String Data""
example
str=""Shruti""
print(""string is "",str)
Indexing
The position of every character placed in the string starts from 0th position ans step by step it ends at length-1 position
Slicing
Slicing refers to obtaining a sub-string from the given string. The following code will include index 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the variable named var_name
Slicing of the string can be obtained by the following syntax-
string_var[int_start_value:int_stop_value:int_step_value]
var_name[1 : 5]
here start and step value are considered 0 and 1 respectively if not mentioned by the programmmer
isalnum() method

string_variable.isupper()
lower() method
Converts a string into lower case equivalent
string_variable.lower()
upper() method
Converts a string into upper case equivalent
string_variable.upper()
strip() method
It removes leading and trailing spaces in the string
string_variable.strip()
List
A List in Python represents a list of comma-separated values of any data type between square brackets.
var_name = [element1, element2, ...]
These elements can be of different datatypes
Indexing
The position of every elements placed in the string starts from 0th position ans step by step it ends at length-1 position
List is ordered,indexed,mutable and most flexible and dynamic collection of elements in python.
Empty List
This method allows you to create an empty list
my_list = []
index method
Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
list.index(element)

list.extend(iterable)
insert method
Adds an element at the specified position
list.insert(position, element)
pop method
Removes the element at the specified position and returns it
list.pop(position)
remove method
The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a given item from the list
list.remove(element)
clear method

reverse method
Reverses the order of the list
list.reverse()
sort method
Sorts the list
list.sort(reverse=True|False)
Tuples
Tuples are represented as comma-separated values of any data type within parentheses.
Tuple Creation
variable_name = (element1, element2, ...)
These elements can be of different datatypes
Indexing
The position of every elements placed in the string starts from 0th position ans step by step it ends at length-1 position
Tuples are ordered,indexing,immutable and most secured collection of elements
Lets talk about some of the tuple methods:
count method
It returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
tuple.count(value)
index method
It searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position.
tuple.index(value)
Sets
A set is a collection of multiple values which is both unordered and unindexed. It is written in curly brackets.
Set Creation: Way 1
var_name = {element1, element2, ...}
Set Creation: Way 2
var_name = set([element1, element2, ...])
Set is unordered,immutable,non-indexed type of collection.Duplicate elements are not allowed in sets.

The dictionary is an unordered set of comma-separated key:value pairs, within {}, with the requirement that within a dictionary, no two keys can be the same.
Dictionary
<dictionary-name> = {<key>: value, <key>: value ...}
Dictionary is ordered and mutable collection of elements.Dictionary allows duplicate values but not duplicate keys.
Empty Dictionary
By putting two curly braces, you can create a blank dictionary
mydict={}
Adding Element to a dictionary
By this method, one can add new elements to the dictionary
<dictionary>[<key>] = <value>
Updating Element in a dictionary
If a specified key already exists, then its value will get updated
<dictionary>[<key>] = <value>
Deleting an element from a dictionary
del keyword is used to delete a specified key:value pair from the dictionary as follows:
del <dictionary>[<key>]

Indentation
In Python, indentation means the code is written with some spaces or tabs into many different blocks of code to indent it so that the interpreter can easily execute the Python code.
Indentation is applied on conditional statements and loop control statements. Indent specifies the block of code that is to be executed depending on the conditions.
Conditional Statements
The if, elif and else statements are the conditional statements in Python, and these implement selection constructs (decision constructs).
if Statement
if(conditional expression):
    statements
if-else Statement
if(conditional expression):
    statements
else:
    statements
if-elif Statement
if (conditional expression):
    statements
elif (conditional expression):
    statements
else:
    statements
Nested if-else Statement
if (conditional expression):
    if (conditional expression):
        statements
    else:
        statements
else:
    statements
example-
a=15
b=20
c=12
if(a>b and a>c):
      print(a,""is greatest"")
elif(b>c and b>a):
      print(b,"" is greatest"")
else:
    print(c,""is greatest"")
Loops in Python
A loop or iteration statement repeatedly executes a statement, known as the loop body, until the controlling expression is false (0).
For Loop
The for loop of Python is designed to process the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string, one by one.
for <variable> in <sequence>:
    statements_to_repeat
example-
for i in range(1,101,1):
           print(i)
While Loop
A while loop is a conditional loop that will repeat the instructions within itself as long as a conditional remains true.
while <logical-expression>:
    loop-body
example-
i=1
while(i<=100):
        print(i)
        i=i+1
Break Statement
The break statement enables a program to skip over a part of the code. A break statement terminates the very loop it lies within.
for <var> in <sequence>:
    statement1
    if <condition>:
        break
    statement2
statement_after_loop
example-
for i in range(1,101,1):
    print(i ,end="" "")
    if(i==50):
        break
    else:
        print(""Mississippi"")
print(""Thank you"")

            
Continue Statement
The continue statement skips the rest of the loop statements and causes the next iteration to occur.
for <var> in <sequence>:
    statement1
    if <condition> :
        continue
    statement2
    statement3
    statement4
example-
for i in [2,3,4,6,8,0]:
    if (i%2!=0):
        continue
    print(i)
Functions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. You can pass parameters into a function. It helps us to make our code more organized and manageable.
Function Definition
def my_function():
          #statements
def keyword is used before defining the function. 
Function Call
my_function()
Whenever we need that block of code in our program simply call that function name whenever neeeded. If parameters are passed during defing the function we have to pass the parameters while calling that function
example-
def add():       #function defination
        a=10
        b=20
       print(a+b)
add()            #function call
Return statement in Python function
The function return statement return the specified value or data item to the caller. 
return [value/expression]
Arguments in python function
Arguments are the values passed inside the parenthesis of the function while defining as well as while calling.
def my_function(arg1,arg2,arg3....argn):
          #statements
my_function(arg1,arg2,arg3....argn)
example-
def add(a,b):
      return a+b
x=add(7,8)
print(x)
File Handling
File handling refers to reading or writing data from files. Python provides some functions that allow us to manipulate data in the files.
open() function
var_name = open(""file name"", "" mode"")
modes-
r - to read the content from file
w - to write the content into file
a - to append the existing content into file
r+:  To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will be overridden.
w+: To write and read data. It will override existing data.
a+: To append and read data from the file. It won’t override existing data.
close() function
var_name.close()
read () function
The read functions contains different methods, read(),readline() and readlines()
read() #return one big string
It returns a list of lines
readlines() #returns a list
It returns one line at a time
readline #returns one line at a time
write function
This function writes a sequence of strings to the file.
write() #Used to write a fixed sequence of characters to a file
It is used to write a list of strings
writelines()
Exception Handling
An exception is an unusual condition that results in an interruption in the flow of a program.
try and except
A basic try-catch block in python. When the try block throws an error, the control goes to the except block.
try:
    [Statement body block]
    raise Exception()
except Exceptionname:
    [Error processing block]
else
The else block is executed if the try block have not raise any exception and code had been running successfully
try:
     #statements
except:
     #statements
else:
      #statements
finally
Finally block will be executed even if try block of code has been running successsfully or except block of code is been executed. finally block of code will be executed compulsory
Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)
It is a programming approach that primarily focuses on using objects and classes. The objects can be any real-world entities.
class
The syntax for writing a class in python
class class_name:
    pass #statements
Creating an object
Instantiating an object can be done as follows:
<object-name> = <class-name>(<arguments>)
self parameter
The self parameter is the first parameter of any function present in the class. It can be of different name but this parameter is must while defining any function into class as it is used to access other data members of the class
class with a constructor
Constructor is the special function of the class which is used to initialize the objects. The syntax for writing a class with the constructor in python
class CodeWithHarry:

    # Default constructor
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = ""CodeWithHarry""

    # A method for printing data members
    def print_me(self):
        print(self.name)
Inheritance in python
By using inheritance, we can create a class which uses all the properties and behavior of another class. The new class is known as a derived class or child class, and the one whose properties are acquired is known as a base class or parent class.
It provides the re-usability of the code.
class Base_class:
       pass
class derived_class(Base_class):
        pass
Types of inheritance-
Single inheritance
Multiple inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
filter function
The filter function allows you to process an iterable and extract those items that satisfy a given condition
filter(function, iterable)
issubclass function
Used to find whether a class is a subclass of a given class or not as follows
issubclass(obj, classinfo) # returns true if obj is a subclass of classinfo
Iterators and Generators
Here are some of the advanced topics of the Python programming language like iterators and generators
Iterator
Used to create an iterator over an iterable
iter_list = iter(['Harry', 'Aakash', 'Rohan']) 
print(next(iter_list)) 
print(next(iter_list)) 
print(next(iter_list))
Generator
Used to generate values on the fly
# A simple generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n
    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n
    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n
Decorators
Decorators are used to modifying the behavior of a function or a class. They are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.
property Decorator (getter)
@property
def name(self):
    return self.__name
setter Decorator
It is used to set the property 'name'
@name.setter
def name(self, value):
    self.__name=value
deleter Decorator
It is used to delete the property 'name'
@name.deleter #property-name.deleter decorator
def name(self, value):
    print('Deleting..')
    del self.__name

Crontab as fast as possible!,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/crontab-crash-course/,"In this post, I will talk about the only crontab commands you will ever need if you are managing a web server. Crontab stands for cron table which is a list of commands that would automatically run at a scheduled interval of time.
For instance, I run a bash file that prerenders all the routes from the CodeWithHarry blog. This saves me the time for manually doing the same when new blogs are added. You might want to update your sitemap, update your blog index or take backups every 24 hours, every week or every month.
List all the cronjobs scheduled by the current user
crontab -l
Add a new cron job
crontab -e
The following window will then open once you choose your editor by pressing 1 followed by enter:
Following are some of the ways you can add cronjobs to a Linux machine using the following command
MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD
Field    Description    Allowed Value
MIN      Minute field    0 to 59
HOUR     Hour field      0 to 23
DOM      Day of Month    1-31
MON      Month field     1-12
DOW      Day Of Week     0-6
CMD      Command         Any command to be executed.
Following will run the command /home/harry/backup.sh on 11:34 AM 17th May of every year:
34 11 17 05 * bash /home/harry/backup.sh
Some other cron special Keywords
Following keywords makes the job of a programmer easy by providing keywords for quick job runs
Keyword    Equivalent
@yearly    0 0 1 1 *
@daily     0 0 * * *
@hourly    0 * * * *
@reboot    Run at startup.
1. The following command will execute the backup.sh file daily:
@daily bash /home/harry/backup.sh
2. The following command will execute the backup.sh file monthly:
@monthly bash /home/harry/backup.sh
3. The following command will execute the backup.sh file yearly:
@yearly bash /home/harry/backup.sh
For anything more than this, you can always refer to the Linux Manpage for Cron
Hope this article helps. Happy Coding!"

Windows 11 Leaked - What's new and why its exciting?,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/windows-11-iso-leaked/,"Windows 11 is an upcoming version of Microsoft Windows. It will be the successor to Windows 10. Microsoft said that it was going to announce the next version of Windows on June 24, but the complete Windows 11 OS has appeared online, and it was first published at Chinese site Baidu.
Let's talk about the new features and updates that Windows 11 carries.
A better user interface
There's splendid news to all the UI lovers because Windows 11 comes with a cool-looking User Interface. Though there are not many changes, yet you will surely see the effect.
It features an updated UI that follows the company's Fluent Design guidelines viz. translucency, shadows, and rounded corners are prevalent throughout the system.
Start Menu
Microsoft has completely redesigned the Start Menu. It is simplified i.e. no more live tiles on the Start Menu. Instead, you'll find standard icons that show pinned apps, even recommended apps and files.
Taskbar
The taskbar has been renovated in Windows 11 as well. It is made streamlined and centered by default.
Round corners 
Windows and menus appear to have somewhat rounded edges. If you are a UI praiser, then for sure you are going to love the new design. It's one of the most stunning designs by windows OS.
More colors to paint and notepad 
Windows 11 comes with the new look of Paint and Notepad. These apps now look more clean and soft, thus giving a unique experience to its users.
Icons and typography have been updated in the paint app. It doesn't look like there are new functionalities in the app, but it has been given a new fresh look. 
Android Apps
This is something that I liked the most. With the new Windows 11, you can use most Android apps directly on your windows without using any android emulator such as Bluestack, etc.
Microsoft has done a partnership with Amazon to bring the Amazon Appstore to the Microsoft Store. It means you can use all the apps available on Amazon Appstore on your windows directly.
  There is a new option in Windows 11 that allows us to split views, and you can do so by clicking on the maximize button. You can split the view with two, three, or four apps on the screen at once. It makes the thing lot easier as earlier we have to do it manually.
The folder icons now look more playful and colorful. The animations look and feel fluid. 
There are some other changes to the system that are new icons, sounds, and widgets. There is a dedicated button in the taskbar to add widgets. 
So, this leak now verifies that Windows 11 will be officially revealed later this month."
How to deploy a Node.js application in production,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/deploy-nodejs-app-on-ubuntu/,"In this post, we will see how to run and deploy NodeJS apps in production. Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Install Nodejs
Let's download nodejs from Nodesource. NodeSource is a company which provides enterprise-grade Node support and maintains a repository containing the latest versions of Node.js.
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
Let's install nodejs now:
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
Check the installation of node and npm using the following commands:
node --version && npm --version
You will see the versions of nodejs and npm
Step 2 - Creating a sample nodejs file
Let's create a sample app and paste some basic code into it.
sudo vi app.js
Paste the following code inside it:
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
Lets now install express so that we can run this app server:
npm install express
run the application
node app.js
You should now be able to see the hello world page when you visit http://server-ip:3000
Step 3 - Using pm2 as a process manager
Let's install and use pm2 as a process manager. Install pm2 using the commands below:
sudo npm i pm2 -g
Start the application using the following command:
pm2 start app.js
Step 4 - Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy
Now let's configure Nginx as a reverse proxy. This will help us get the security features from Nginx. Also, we can serve static content using Nginx.
Let's install Nginx using the following command:
sudo apt install nginx
Let's create a conf file for our Nodejs app using the command below
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodeApp
Copy the following content to this file
server{
  server_name 165.232.177.116;

      location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
Activate this configuration using the command below:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nodeApp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
Visit http://your-ip/ and your application should work fine. Happy coding!"
How to deploy flask app on Ubuntu VPS using Nginx and gunicorn,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/flask-app-deploy-using-gunicorn-nginx/,"In this post, we will see how to deploy flask applications using gunicorn WSGI server and nginx as a reverse proxy and static files server.
Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Install required packages
sudo apt update
Now let's install python3, python3-pip, and Nginx using the commands below:
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev nginx
Step 2 - Creating a directory (for our flask app) and virtual environment
Let's install virtualenv
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
Lets now create a directory to host our flask application
mkdir myFlaskApp && cd myFlaskApp
run the following command to create a virtual environment named env
virtualenv env
Finally activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate
Lets now install flask and gunicorn using pip
pip3 install flask gunicorn
Step 3 - Creating a sample project and wsgi entry point
Let us now create a sample project by entering the command below:
vim app.py
Paste the contents below to app.py file
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return ""Hello World!""
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0')
Next, we’ll create a file that will serve as the entry point for our application. This will tell our Gunicorn server how to interact with the application.
vim wsgi.py
copy the contents below to wsgi.py
from app import app

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    app.run()
We can test gunicorn's ability to serve our project by running the command below:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app
Folder structure so far:
myFlaskApp
  |____ app.py
  |____ wsgi.py
  |____ env
Lets deactivate our virtual environment now:
deactivate
Step 4 - Creating a systemd service
Lets now create a systemd service using the following commands:
vim /etc/systemd/system/app.service
Now paste the contents below to this file:
[Unit]
#  specifies metadata and dependencies
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve myproject
After=network.target
# tells the init system to only start this after the networking target has been reached
# We will give our regular user account ownership of the process since it owns all of the relevant files
[Service]
# Service specify the user and group under which our process will run.
User=harry
# give group ownership to the www-data group so that Nginx can communicate easily with the Gunicorn processes.
Group=www-data
# We'll then map out the working directory and set the PATH environmental variable so that the init system knows where our the executables for the process are located (within our virtual environment).
WorkingDirectory=/home/harry/myFlaskApp/
Environment=""PATH=/home/harry/myFlaskApp/env/bin""
# We'll then specify the commanded to start the service
ExecStart=/home/harry/myFlaskApp/env/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:app.sock -m 007 wsgi:app
# This will tell systemd what to link this service to if we enable it to start at boot. We want this service to start when the regular multi-user system is up and running:
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Activate this service by typing:
sudo systemctl start app
sudo systemctl enable app
A file named app.sock will be automatically created. Folder structure so far:
myFlaskApp
  |____ app.py
  |____ wsgi.py
  |____ env
  |____ app.sock
  Step 5 - Configuring Nginx
Create a file named app inside /etc/nginx/sites-available
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/app
Now copy the below contents to this file:
server {
listen 80;
server_name 165.232.177.116;

location / {
  include proxy_params;
  proxy_pass http://unix:/home/harry/myFlaskApp/app.sock;
    }
}                
Important: I have used my server IP, you should use yours!
Activate this configuration by executing this:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
Restart nginx and your website should work fine!
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Visiting http://165.232.177.116/ on browser shows a page like this
If you are using a firewall (for eg. ufw), don't forget to allow nginx to receive incoming traffic on port 80
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

How to host Django Application using gunicorn & nginx in Production,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/django-deploy-nginx-gunicorn/,"In this post, we will see how to use nginx with gunicorn to serve django applications in production. 
Django is a very powerful web framework and ships with a server which is able to facilitate development. This development server is not scalable and is not suited for production. Hence we need to configure gunicorn to get better scalability and nginx can be used as a reverse proxy and as a web server to serve static files. Let's get started 
Before you follow the steps outlined below, I will assume that you have already configured your Ubuntu server with a non root user and firewall as outlined here.
Step 1 - Installing python and nginx
Let's update the server's package index using the command below:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev nginx
This will install python, pip and nginx server
Step 2 - Creating a python virtual environment 
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
This will install a virtual environment package in python. Let's create a project directory to host our Django application and create a virtual environment inside that directory.
mkdir ~/projectdir
cd ~/projectdir
virtualenv env
A virtual environment named env will be created. Let's activate this virtual environment:
source env/bin/activate
Step 3 - Installing Django and gunicorn
pip install django gunicorn
This installs Django and gunicorn in our virtual environment
Step 4 - Setting up our Django project
At this point you can either copy your existing Django project into the projectdir folder or create a fresh one as shown below:
django-admin startproject textutils ~/projectdir
Add your IP address or domain to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py.
If you have any migrations to run, perform that action:
~/projectdir/manage.py makemigrations
~/projectdir/manage.py migrate
Let's test this sample project by running the following commands:
sudo ufw allow 8000
This opens port 8000 by allowing it over the firewall. Let's start our Django development server to test the setup so far:
~/projectdir/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Step 5 - Configuring gunicorn
Lets test gunicorn's ability to serve our application by firing the following commands:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 textutils.wsgi
This should start gunicorn on port 8000. We can go back to the browser to test our application. Visiting http://<ip-address>:8000 shows a page like this:
Deactivate the virtualenvironment by executing the command below:
deactivate
Let's create a system socket file for gunicorn now:
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket
Paste the contents below and save the file
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
Next, we will create a service file for gunicorn
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
Paste the contents below inside this file:
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
Requires=gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
User=harry
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/harry/projectdir
ExecStart=/home/harry/projectdir/env/bin/gunicorn \
          --access-logfile - \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
          textutils.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Lets now start and enable the gunicorn socket
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
Step 6 - Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy
Create a configuration file for Nginx using the following command
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/textutils
Paste the below contents inside the file created
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.codewithharry.in;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/harry/projectdir;
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
Activate the configuration using the following command:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/textutils /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Restart nginx and allow the changes to take place.
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Your Django website should now work fine! Happy Coding"

Step 1 - Installing phpMyAdmin
Enter the following command to install PHPMyAdmin
sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl
Step 2 - Configuring MySQL to use a password
Now we will configure password login to MySQL for logging into PHPMyAdmin
Open MySQL console
sudo mysql
and execute the following query to create a new user to be used for PHPMyAdmin. 
CREATE USER 'harry'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'MyStrongPassword1234$';
This creates a new MySQL user named harry with the password - 'MyStrongPassword1234$'
Let's provide this user all the privileges so that we can use it to access the PHPMyAdmin console. Execute the query below
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'harry'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Let's exit the MySQL console now
exit
Step 3 - Create a symlink
You’ll now need to create a symbolic link from the PHPMyAdmin files to Nginx’s document root directory. This will tell Nginx where PhpMyAdmin files are and how to serve them!
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/phpmyadmin
Step 4 - Check the installation
Restart Nginx using the command below:
sudo service nginx restart
Now go to the http://<your-server-ip>/phpmyadmin from your browser and login using the username and password you used in step 2.
You should be able to see the PHPMyAdmin interface.

"How to install LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) on Ubuntu 20.04",01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-20/,"In this tutorial, we will install the LEMP stack on the ubuntu 20 based server. LEMP consists of Linux, Nginx(pronounced as Engine-x), MySQL for database, and PHP as a backend programming language. Together you can use this combination to host a set of high-performing sites on a single server. I will assume that you have finished the initial server setup as described here on your ubuntu server before installing the LEMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04.
If you are already using some other web server like apache2, it is recommended that you uninstall it or rebuild your server from scratch using the console provided by your hosting provider. DigitalOcean gives a convenient way to achieve this in its dashboard.
Let's install the LEMP stack now. Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Update the server's package index
Update the server's package index by executing the command below:
sudo apt update
Step 2 - Install Nginx
Install Nginx using the command below:
sudo apt install nginx
Step 3 - Allow Nginx through the firewall
Allow Nginx through the firewall using the command below:
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
You can now go to your server's IP address to check if Nginx is installed successfully. You should see a page like this:
Step 4 - Installing MySQL
Let's install MySQL using the command below:
sudo apt install mysql-server
This command will install MySQL, and you will be able to see the console by entering ""sudo mysql"" in the terminal.
sudo mysql
Step 5 - Installing PHP
The last component in the LEMP stack is PHP. Let's install it using the command below:

How to get free https on your site using Let's Encrypt SSL on Ubuntu 20.04,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/get-https-ubuntu-using-lets-encrypt/,"Have you ever seen that green padlock at the top in the URL bar which reads ""Connection is secure""? In this post, we will discuss how to enable HTTPS for your website hosted on ubuntu 20.04. We will use let's encrypt for this purpose which is a non-profit certificate authority used to get SSL certificates for your website. 
Not only that we can use certbot to automatically renew these certificates which makes it a one-time task for a single domain.
We will assume that you already have a domain pointed to the IP address of your VPS. Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Install lets encrypt
Execute the following commands to install let's encrypt on ubuntu:
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
Step 2 - Allow HTTPS through the firewall and configure apache2 virtual hosts
If you are using apache, enter the following commands to allow apache2 over the firewall:
sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
Step 3 - Obtain an SSL certificate
Run the following command to obtain an SSL certificate
sudo certbot --apache
This command shows you some prompts and finally installs an SSL certificate on the domain of your choice.
Step 4 - Test the auto-renewal process
Certbot, by itself, takes care of the auto-renewal process of your SSL certificate. You can test the auto-renewal of your SSL certificate by firing the following commands:
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
You can even dry run the auto-renewal by using the below command:
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
Hope this guide was helpful for you to install an SSL certificate on your server. Happy coding!"
Installing phpMyAdmin and adding password authentication to MySQL on Ubuntu,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/install-phpmyadmin-ubuntu/,"In this video, we will see how to install and secure phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 20.04. phpMyAdmin was created to easily interact with MySQL databases using a web-based interface. I will assume that you have configured a non-root user on your ubuntu machine and installed the lamp stack.
We will also see how to enable password authentication on MySQL which supports socket-based authentication by default.
Step 1 - Installing PHPMyAdmin 
Let's update our server's package index
sudo apt update
Run the following command to install phpMyAdmin and related packages
sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl
Using this command we installed the following packages:
php-mbstring: A module for managing non-ASCII strings with different encodings
php-zip: An extension that facilitates uploading .zip files to phpMyAdmin
php-gd: Enables support for GD graphics library
php-json: Provides support for JSON serialization
php-curl: Allows PHP to communicate with other servers
While installing PHPMyAdmin you will see a prompt that will ask you to select the webserver. Press <Spacebar> <Tab> and then enter key to continue the installation.
You will also be asked to continue with dbconfig-common setup. Press enter to confirm.
Finally, choose and confirm a strong password for PHPMyAdmin. If you get a prompt asking for the services which need to be restarted, simply press the ""tab"" and then ""enter"" key to continue. Phpmyadmin is now installed on your Ubuntu server
Step 2 - Configuring password access in MySQL 
to use MySQL we need to enable password login in MySQL. enter the following command to launch the MySQL console:
sudo mysql
Now enter the following query to enable password authentication in MySQL 
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'MyStrongPassword1234$';
Please make sure you choose your own password and not the one which I chose ('MyStrongPassword1234$')
You can always check the authentication method used by using the following MySQL query:
SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
Exit from the MySQL console by typing exit.
Now you can log in using your MySQL password by entering the following command to the MySQL console
sudo mysql -u root -p
Step 3 - Configuring a non-root user in MySQL
Since its not a good idea to use root as your login user, we will create another MySQL user named harry to login to the PHPMyAdmin console:
Execute the following query:
CREATE USER 'harry'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'MyStrongPassword1234$';
This creates a user named harry with the password - 'MyStrongPassword1234$'
Let's provide this user all the privileges so that we can use it to access the PHPMyAdmin console. Execute the query below
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'harry'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
You can now exit the MySQL shell:
exit
Step 4 - Accessing phpMyAdmin 
Go to the browser and type 'http://your_domain_or_IP/phpmyadmin' in your URL bar. You will see an option to log into your PHPMyAdmin console. Enter the username (harry in my case) and password you chose for this user. 
You will be logged in to PHPMyAdmin.
Enjoy managing your MySQL databases with ease and security. Happy coding!"
How to Host Multiple Websites on Ubuntu VPS?,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/host-multiple-websites-ubuntu-vps/,"An apache2 web server provides robustness and scalability for hosting multiple websites on your Ubuntu VPS. This means you can utilize the power of your VPS hardware without any downtime on your website.
We can configure apache2 to host multiple websites on the same VPS. To achieve this using apache, we create virtual hosts corresponding to each domain or individual site. A virtual host is a way to direct traffic corresponding to an IP to a specific directory on our VPS. This way we will be able to host multiple websites on a single Ubuntu server.
How to setup a virtual host in apache2
If you haven't already installed apache2, you can do so by entering the below command in the ubuntu terminal
sudo apt install apache2
Assuming you have apache2 installed on your machine, all you need to do now is to follow the steps outlined in the next section to host multiple websites. For the sake of this tutorial, I will assume that we have to host 2 websites codewithharry.com and programmingwithharry.com on our ubuntu VPS. We will point the domains to the IP address of our droplets. Here is how A record is set up in GoDaddy.
The process is pretty similar for other domain providers
Let's set up our virtual hosts now
Step 1 - Creating Directories for individual sites
Let's create individual directories to store the contents of codewithharry.com and programmingwithharry.com. Execute the commands below to create these directories inside the /var/www folder
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/codewithharry.com/
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/programmingwithharry.com/
Step 2 - Transfer the site contents
Transfer the index.html and related files to the individual site directories using Filezilla
Step 3 - Creating the VirtualHost files
Create a new file inside the /etc/apache2/sites-available/ directory by firing the following commands below:
 sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/codewithharry.com.conf
Once the codewithharry.com.conf file is created. paste the below contents inside it
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName codewithharry.com
    ServerAdmin yourPublicEmail@email.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/codewithharry.com
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
Repeat the same for programmingwithharry.com by executing the command below:
 vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/programmingwithharry.com.conf
and paste the below contents:
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName programmingwithharry.com
    ServerAdmin yourPublicEmail@email.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/programmingwithharry.com
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
Step 4 - Enable the VirtualHosts
In order for these virtual host files to function correctly, we need to enable them.
Enter the directory where we have created virtual hosts:
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
Execute the following commands to enable the virtual hosts:
sudo a2ensite codewithharry.com.conf
sudo a2ensite programmingwithharry.com.conf
Finally, you will have to restart the apache server:
sudo service apache2 restart
Step 5 - Test the configuration
Test the configuration of these virtual hosts by visiting your domains. You can configure as many virtual hosts as you want for your domains and this technique can help you power many websites on a single VPS.
Hope this will help you host your websites and save some money on VPS. Happy Coding!"
Installing LAMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04 in 5 Minutes,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/lamp-stack-ubuntu-20-04/,"This post will explain how to install LAMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04. LAMP stack consists of the following components:
Linux - Any Linux based operating system
Apache server - Apache is an open-source webserver
MySQL - MySQL database
PHP - PHP as a server-side programming language
These components work together to host single or multiple dynamic websites that are stable in production.
I will be using DigitalOcean for creating the VPS but you can use any service provider of your choice. As long as the operating system of your server is Ubuntu, this guide will work.
Before you go ahead and start installing the LAMP stack on Ubuntu, make sure you have a non-root user configured along with a server firewall for security purposes. If you don't know what I mean, have a look at this article to configure a non-root sudo user and a firewall on your server before you proceed further.
Installing Apache and allowing it through the firewall
Apache is an amazing open-source web server. Let's install it using the following commands:
sudo apt update
This command updates the package lists for upgrades. Let's run it to ensure that we install the up-to-date versions of the software later.
sudo apt install apache2
Press Y when prompted and the installation will finish after a while.
Let's allow Apache through the firewall using the following command:
sudo ufw allow in ""Apache Full""
You can always issue the ""sudo ufw status"" command to verify the changes:
sudo ufw status
You can now go to the server URL (IP address) and the apache2 default page will be displayed on the screen
Congratulations! You have successfully installed the apache web server on your server
Installing MySQL on Ubuntu
MySQL is a very popular and open source database that can be used with almost any application to store huge amounts of data effectively.
Execute the following command to install MySQL on ubuntu:
sudo apt install mysql-server
confirm the installation by typing 'y' followed by the 'Enter'.
You should be able to login to MySQL console by typing the following command:

sudo mysql
To exit the MySQL console type exit in the MySQL console
exit
Installing PHP
We can install PHP by firing the following commands:
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
This will install the following 3 packages
php -  installs PHP
libapache2-mod-php - Used by apache to handle PHP files
php-mysql - PHP module that allows PHP to connect to MySQL 
Confirm the PHP installation by executing the below command:
php -v
Congratulations! You have successfully installed LAMP stack on your server. If you have any doubts, feel free to drop a comment below and I will get back to you!"
"Transferring Files, Passwordless login & Managing multiple servers",01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/transferring-files-passwordless-login-ubuntu-20-04/,"In this post, I will show you how to avoid entering passwords multiple times while managing your servers. Also, I will tell you few tricks I use to manage multiple servers efficiently. Let's start with uploading files to the server
Uploading files to your server
In order to upload files to your server, you can use an SFTP client like Filezilla which simply can be used by entering your server IP, username, and password. Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Download and install Filezilla
FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS, and SFTP client with lots of useful features and an intuitive graphical user interface. Download this free software from here
Install Filezilla on your computer and open it.
Step 2 - Login to your server using FileZilla
Enter your server IP, username, and password inside the boxes at the top in FileZilla. Make sure your enter 22 as the port. Press enter and wait for some time.
Step 3 - Uploading files to your server
You can now upload files to your server by navigating to the directory of your choice and dragging/dropping your files into the folder(on your server) of your choice.
Enabling passwordless login to your server
Every time we need to log in to our server, we type 'ssh user@ip-address' command followed by the strong password which is quite cumbersome.
We can avoid typing this strong password without having to compromise security by authorizing our machine to log in to the server without the password every time we type a single (short) command. Follow the steps below:
Step 1 - Create a private-public key pair
We can create a private-public key pair using ssh-keygen. Execute the following command on your server:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
This generates a private-public key pair on your computer. Press enter 3 times to choose the default options.
Step 2 - Deploy ssh key on your server
Login to your server using ssh(preferably non-root user) and password and execute the following command:
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
This will create a .ssh in the home directory ('/home/harry/' in my case) of your user. DigitalOcean droplet ships with a root account so creating this '.ssh' directory is not needed if you want to configure serverless login for root.
Execute the following command on your host computer:
scp C:\Users\Harry\.ssh\id_rsa.pub harry@165.232.177.116:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Replace 'C:\Users\Harry' with your user home directory on Windows. You will be prompted for the password. Enter your password and your ssh key will be deployed.
Step 3 - Test your passwordless login
Try to log into your server by entering the following command. Replace user with your username and ip-address with your server's ip address
ssh user@ip-address
Quick login using Powershell profiles
If you are using Windows Powershell, you can use PowerShell profiles to efficiently log in to multiple servers. Personally, I manage multiple servers including the one which hosts this site. I need to switch from a personal server to my client's server on a very regular basis. It gets hectic to remember multiple passwords and type them repeatedly. Hence I use PowerShell functions to manage multiple servers. If you are overwhelmed, don't! This is easier than you think and once you configure it you will never look back. Follow the below steps:
Step 1 - Create a PowerShell profile
Create a PowerShell profile using the command below:
 New-Item $profile -Type File -Force
This creates a PowerShell profile that will execute whenever you start PowerShell on your computer.
Step 2 - Open and add a function to the PowerShell profile
Open your PowerShell profile by executing the following command on Windows:
notepad $profile
As a part of the next step, we will add few functions to our PowerShell profile. Paste the following code to your profile
echo ""Hello Harry, Welcome to PowerShell. Your profile works!"" 

function personal{
    Start-Process ssh harry@189.59.45.126
}

function client1{
    Start-Process ssh harry@139.39.45.126
}

function client2{
    Start-Process ssh root@239.59.45.126
}
Replace the usernames and IP addresses with the actual values of your servers. Finally, save and close the file.
Step 3 - Test your profile
If you don't restart PowerShell you will see an error like this:
PS C:\Users\Harry> notepad $profile
PS C:\Users\Harry> client2
client2 : The term 'client2' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or
if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ client2
+ ~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (client2:String) [], CommandNotFou
   ndException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
Restart your PowerShell and type client2:
Your profile should now work. Close all the PowerShell instances and reopen PowerShell. Now try to execute any one of the following commands:
personal
client1
client2
Wow we are now able to open the server we created for our client by issuing a single word command ie 'client1'
Note: You can always configure serverless login for a root user but using a root account for day-to-day activities is not recommended.
You can configure as many servers as you want of your choice. Hope you understood and will start incorporating this into your server workflows. Happy coding!

Setting Up an Ubuntu 20.04 server for deployment,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/setup-ubuntu-20-04-server/,"When you first create a server from any provider like Linode, DigitalOcean, etc., you will have to secure it by executing several commands. This post will explain what those commands are and why you need to run all those commands to start using your server securely.
I will break down the procedure we will perform into 5 simple steps:
Creating a VPS
Initial Login 
Creating a non-root user
Firewall setup
Let's get started
Creating a VPS
For creating a VPS, I will choose DigitalOcean. I have been DigitalOcean for quite a while now, and it never disappointed me. There are other service providers like Linode, Vultr, etc.
Once you create an account on DigitalOcean and log in, DigitalOcean will present you with this screen. Click on create and then on droplets:
DigitalOcean will present you with the following screen, where you can choose the droplet, Operating system, and plan size. I will choose the options as marked in red below:
Choose a region. Ideally, this has to be the region closest to your users. This is the physical location where the server will be located:
Finally, choose a password and click create droplet:
You will see processing like this
and finally, we will get a public IP address
We will use this public IP address to login into our server
Initial Login
The very first step to start using a server is to log in to it. A web server is just like a computer on the web. We cannot connect a physical keyboard and mouse to it. So how do we use it?  We will use an SSH Client to get access to the server's terminal (this remote computer), and once we have access to the terminal, we can start executing commands on this server. 
To log in to our server, we need to know its public IP address, just like you need to know the address of a place before visiting it. 
Execute the following command on the PowerShell or terminal
ssh root@your_server_ip
I will type this:
ssh root@165.232.177.116
Enter the password provided by your service provider. We have created a password in DigitalOcean, which we will enter here. Once you enter the password when prompted, you will be logged in as root.
The root user is a user having the highest privileges on the server. This means that a root user can do anything and everything on the server. This is why it is strongly discouraged to use a root account as it might accidentally delete files/uninstall programs/install programs etc. Hence we will create a user who will have restricted permissions on the server for day-to-day use.
Creating a non-root user
We will now create a non-root user account that will have restricted access to the machine. This is ideal if you want to have people working for you on the server without doing everything on the server.
Execute the following command:
adduser harry
You will be asked to enter some information and a password. Choose a strong password to avoid getting hacked!
We have successfully created an account with basic access. We want this user to be able to elevate to root access when required. This will be useful when you want to use your server and sometimes do something which requires root access.
This will save you the time to log out and log back in as the root user.
Execute the following command on the server:
usermod -aG sudo harry
Firewall setup
Our server is public, and we want to protect it from external unwanted connections. We want only selected services exposed to the public on our server.
We will set up the UFW firewall on our Ubuntu 20.04 server and allow OpenSSH, which allows us to connect to our server.
Execute the following command to allow OpenSSH:
ufw allow OpenSSH
Enable the firewall by executing the following command:
ufw enable
The firewall will now block all the connections except SSH
You have successfully created a new user. Try to log in through this user in a new terminal tab and verify everything works before logging out from the current session.
You can type the following command to elevate to the root access as and when required.
sudo su
To go back to the existing user, execute the following command:
exit

CSS ideas to spark your Web page,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/css-ideas-to-spark-your-web-page/,"Introduction
Cascading Style Sheets referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to style HTML elements selectively. Learning new CSS tricks is one of the best ways to shake up your website design.
Here are a few of the helpful CSS tricks that will definitely help.
1.Selection in CSS
On the web, we select content for different reasons. Maybe we want to copy a text and quote it somewhere, or maybe copying is just a habit that some users do it make reading easier. Usually, when the user selects any text on the web page, it has a white color with a blue background as blue. Why keep your webpage simple and the same as others. Here is an amazing trick.
p::selection{
          background-color: pink;
          color: rgb(235, 23,41);
}
The above code has a function of displaying red text with background color pink when selected.
  2.Why use more space?
The CSS overflow-x property defines what to do when content overflows the content box horizontally (i.e., left and right), such as displaying the content outside of the content box, clipping the content, or displaying a horizontal scroll bar.
 div { overflow-x: hidden; }
In that above line of code, the content is clipped, the overflow content is hidden, and no horizontal scroll bar is displayed. This will display the webpage with no scroll bar horizontally, and hence no space will be wasted.
Note: Various other parameters are also available with overflow-x.
  3.Negation pseudo-class
For selecting an element that doesn’t have a certain class and in the case of multiple classes, the "":not()"" selector is used.
body:not(p){
               color:purple;
}
The above code will not apply the color purple for the tag <p>.
  4.Blend Mode
With background-blend mode, we define the blending between the element’s background image and its background color.
body {
           background-image : url(p1.jpg);
           background-color: purple;
           background-blend-mode :screen;
}
  5.Scroll behavior control
The scroll-behavior property specifies whether to smoothly animate the scroll position, instead of a straight jump, when the user clicks on a link within a scrollable box.
*{
             padding: 0;
             margin: 0;
             scroll-behaviour: smooth;
}
This can be useful when you want to move from down to top just by the click of a button"

How To Install and Setup VirtualBox in Windows 10 in 2021?,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/install-virtualbox-windows-2021/,"If you are an IT professional or an IT student, I am sure you will definitely encounter a situation where you will need to work on multiple operating systems. One way to install more than one operating system is dual booting your computer, but this can be difficult for a beginner. The most recommended and the easiest method is installing Oracle Virtual Box. Virtual Box gives you the functionality of running multiple operating systems on your host operating system. This article will tell you how you can install the latest Virtual Box version in the Windows 10 operating system.
Follow the steps given below to install Virtual Box on Windows 10:
First of all, you need to download the Virtual Box installer. Click here, and you will be redirected to the official download page of Virtual Box. Download the binary version for Windows hosts.
Run the executable file as soon as the download completes.
A custom setup dialog box will be displayed after starting the executable file, as shown in the below animation.
Click on the “Next” button to install Virtual Box in the default settings and location, or you can change the installation directory by clicking on the “Browse” button.
Virtual Box will give you a Network Interface Warning as shown in the below animation during the installation. Proceed further by clicking “Yes.”

After that, Virtual Box should be installed on your computer. Now, you can easily install the operating system of your choice by launching the Virtual Box.
Checking “Start Oracle VM Virtual Box” will launch the Virtual Box just after installation. Uncheck this option if you want to launch Virtual Box later. So, that’s how you easily install Virtual Box in Windows 10."
How to Find Your Computer IP Address on Windows 10,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/find-ip-address-windows-10/,"This article will tell you how you can easily find your public and private IP address on Windows 10. But before that, let’s get familiar with what is IP address:
Let’s suppose it’s your birthday, and your uncle who lives in America wants to send you a present. But he doesn’t know your home address. Will he be able to send you the present? Of course not!
Just like you have your home address to receive mails, couriers, etc, your computer on which you are reading this article also has addresses for receiving data from the web. This address is nothing but an IP address. Every single website you visit on the internet has a unique IP address. Yes, this website also has a unique address. IP addresses help us to pinpoint every device which is connected to the internet. Now, let’s talk about the versions of IP address:
IPv4 address :
It stands for Internet Protocol Version 4
4 bytes each
3 billion possible addresses
Example: 192.168.0.102
Ipv6 address:
It stands for Internet Protocol Version 6
128 bytes each
340 undecillion possible addresses
Example : fe80::9016:9401:8b91:1d36%16
You might be thinking about why we need two different versions of IP addresses? Let me answer this question for you. Have you noticed that only 4.3 billion IP addresses are possible if we use IPv4, but an explosive growth of internet devices has been noticed in the past few years? Back in 2011, we ran out of IPv4 addresses. Even Microsoft was ready to pay millions of dollars to buy unused IP addresses. That’s why we need an IPv6 address. Don’t worry! IPv6 is designed in such a way that we will never run out of IPv6 addresses.
Now, let’s talk about the WAN(Wide Area Network) IP address and LAN(Local Area Network) IP address. Any device connected to the internet has a WAN IP and a LAN IP. You might be thinking earlier that we have a unique IP, and now I’m saying that every device has two IPs. Sounds confusing? Stick with me on this article, and you will get your answer.
Every device has two IPs(WAN and LAN)
WAN is the public one.
LAN is the private one.
The world sees WAN IP.
You only see LAN IP.
LAN IP or internal IP is assigned to your computer by your router.
WAN IP is assigned to your router by your ISP(Internet Service Provider)
How to find your IP Address on Windows command prompt?
Follow the steps given below to find your computer IP address on Windows 10:
Type “cmd ” in the search bar and open the command prompt.
Type “ipconfig” and hit enter.
The IP address shown in the command prompt is your local area address. If you want to find your wide-area address, then open your web browser and head over to whatismyipaddress.com
So, that’s how you can easily check your IP address in Windows 10.

Complete Roadmap to master ML - From Zero to Pro!,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/complete-ml-roadmap-for-beginners/,"“Knowledge isn’t free; you have to pay attention.”
In this post, I will talk about the complete machine learning roadmap for beginners. This post is going to be a bit different. 
I won’t be telling you about the usual stuff and courses but will be walking you through the realistic events that will happen while you are on your ML journey.
I will discuss a personal secret technique, which I call the Parallel Conquering Technique.
One of the reasons beginners get confused when it comes to learning machine learning is that they don’t know what to learn from where and how? There are just too many options for courses, books, and ML algorithms.
I am going to share a set of steps that you should take to master Machine learning.
Step 1: Pick a programming language & Get Started!
The first step to start learning machine learning is to pick up a programming language. There are different programming languages in the market, but the most suitable for machine learning are Python and R.
I recommend Python. Why? Because its popular, easy to learn and future-ready
With Python, you can switch domains easily. Python offers popular frameworks like Django and Flask for backend development, Tkinter for GUI development, Pygames for Game development, etc. Here is my free Python tutorial in Hindi (with notes)
If you go with Python, you must learn sklearn for Machine Learning. Sklearn is a modern machine learning library written in Python. 
The best thing about sklearn is that most of the Machine learning algorithms are written for you already. It has a lot of useful classes for preprocessing your data for further analysis
If you want to learn machine learning in Hindi, I have made an end-to-end machine learning video on CodeWithHarry YouTube channel where I walk you through the steps on tackling a machine learning problem from scratch.
You should also look into the Tensorflow module, which can help you build a neural network without many efforts!
Step 2: Learn Linear Algebra
You should learn Linear Algebra if you wish to master Machine Learning and become a pro!
This is essential because if you want to tune your models with maximum flexibility, you need to know how they work, and knowing linear algebra is a must for that!
When you start, you should focus on Step 1, and while you are following step 1, you can begin learning Linear Algebra parallelly. This is what I call the parallel conquering technique.
You start two similar things parallelly, focusing on the first and keeping relatively less priority on the other tasks. This can help you keep the enthusiasm and the motivation up.
One of the resources I found very helpful for revisiting linear algebra concepts was this pdf notes.
Step 3: Learn Statistics
Having a basic understanding of probability and statistics is important when it comes to mastering Machine Learning. 
Here is one of the best resources for that: Statistics Revision Notes by MathBox
Step 4: Learn Core ML Algorithms
Once you have some idea of using sklearn after learning python, you should start looking into how these machine learning algorithms work. 
While using sklearn, an ML Algorithm is a black box written by the sklearn developers.
In order to get an idea of how these Machine learning algorithms work from within, look into:
Gradient Descent
Slope
Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement Learning
Basic Linear Regression
Working of all such similar models
Clustering
An amazing resource to learn about all this is a book called “Hands-on ML with Scikit learn and tensorflow.” (Not an affiliate link)
Try to grab a copy of this book. It will help you a lot. 
There are few other resources too that are worth looking into:
ML Course from Google
madewithml.com
How to read a book
Schedule your reading time
Try to turn the pages and look for exercise-questions
Now try to find the answers to those questions while reading
These are the points author of the book wants your focus on
Try to use read-aloud feature of Microsoft edge. It works pretty well
Step 5: Learn Python Libraries
Learn Numpy
Learn Pandas
All this will be helpful to debug the python/sklearn code
Step 6: Learn Deployment
To host your machine learning models with a powerful backend, you will need to learn frameworks like Django and Flask.
Docker and Kubernetes can be of great help if you want to ship and deploy your models quickly!
Streamlit is worthy of looking into if you wish to build custom web apps for machine learning and data science

Ultimate Roadmap to Master Android Development,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/roadmap-android-development/,"We can't imagine our lives without Android apps. Over the past two years, the number of mobile phone users has grown rapidly, and the number continues to grow. With this boom in the industry, the demand for Android developers is also growing rapidly.
Most people use mobile devices to surf the internet. The development of Android apps has attracted a lot of attention from the general public. Therefore it’s worthwhile to learn how Android applications are developed!
Today, I will share the tools and resources you will need to learn Android development with you. After going through these resources, you will be able to start building Android applications from scratch. So, let's get started:
1. Tools
Firstly, I will be mentioning which language you should choose. There is Java, Kotlin, and Flutter in the market for Android development. Java and Kotlin are native that you can select to develop App for one platform at a time. Flutter is a hybrid language you can use to develop applications both for Android and iOS phones.
As a beginner, I will suggest you learn java for android because if you are a beginner, then java will be a great first language for you plus, if you know java, you can easily switch to Kotlin whenever you feel like!
2. Xml And Java/Kotlin
If you guys are well familiar with web development, you must be knowing that HTML & CSS are used for designing the layout of your website. Javascript enables the frontend logic on a website.
In a similar way, XML is used for designing the layout of your application on Android. To apply the logic behind the app, we use java.
3. Tips From My Experience
Use a laptop with 4GB+ RAM- It’s recommended to have a laptop having 4Gb plus RAM. It will be better to use 8Gb, but you can use a 4Gb one if you can't afford it.
Use a Laptop with an SSD - What does an SSD do? Basically, SSD reads the files from the hard drive very fastly, and it provides an amazing performance boost to you.
Use an actual phone instead of AVD - In the android studio, you can create an AVD (Android Virtual Device), but if your computer is seeking more resources, you can use your mobile phone in developer mode instead of AVD.
4. Free Learning Resources-
Android in One Video- If you understand Hindi, this is an amazing video that is uploaded on the CodeWithHarry youtube channel. It will be perfect for you to get your hands dirty and start Andriod development. It will give you great enthusiasm, and you will learn a lot about the android studio as well: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahKZ42vg2w9ERPmShYbYAB7. 
Android development fundamentals- This is the platform developed by Google, and it got two courses: Fundamental and Advanced. Google has created this course, so no doubt that this will be a nice course for you to get hands-on experience in Android Development: https://developer.android.com/courses.
Android Development Playlist- This is a detailed playlist that has been uploaded on the CodeWithHarry YouTube channel. It will cover almost all the major topics you will need in your android development journey: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiL0kysYlfSOUgY5rNlOhUd.
→ Note: Learning basic Android development by using the above resources would take you around 15 days.
Udacity's Developing Android Apps- This is a great course, and it’s quite long also. Also, it will cover more advanced topics along with basics like Notifications, Camera Controls, etc. This course will be beneficial if you want to upgrade and learn advanced android development:https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851.
Official Android Documentation - After reaching a certain level, you won’t be relying on any video for fixing errors in your application. You will be visiting documentation or StackOverflow. You will be using API documentation to fix basic issues yourself: https://developer.android.com/samples.
Android Launcher Icon - This is a web-based platform that helps you to render the launcher icon in a very friendly format for your app: https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html.
5. How To Make Money From Android Development?
Let’s come to the part of the blog, most of the people would be eager to read about - How to earn money?
There are a lot of ways to make money from your Android Development skill. Few of which includes:
Freelancing- There are many websites that you might be aware of, like freelancers, Fiverr, Upwork. You need to be patient once you get started, as you might still not get the work in the beginning. But many people manage to make a good amount of money from it. All you need is to establish your authority on one of such platforms, after which your reviews will speak for the quality of work you deliver!
Playstore + AdMob- In the play store, you can publish the app according to its guidelines, plus to upload the app, you have to spend 25$. After that, you can upload as many apps as you want. With the help of AdMob, you can show ads on your application which will help you make some passive income on the go!
Playstore + In-App Purchase - You must be wondering what an In-App purchase is? Suppose you make an application which is a game, and you want to add custom features like getting an armor. Your users can get it after completing a few levels or you can make something like an in-app purchase which will offer your users this armor after paying Rs. 50. Similarly, you can program your application such that if your users pay some money, they will get more features on this app.
Job/Internship - There is a lot of opportunity in the field of Android Development when it comes to internships, so if you are in college and you know android development, then you can easily get an internship and job in the field, and this can be your best target to achieve as a college student.
Social Media- There are many Android Developer groups on the social media platforms, where people seek out some help in their app. You can pitch your idea and make an offer to help them out. This way, you can make a good amount of money and this upgrades your personal skills too!
6. Other Advice
Version control- To become a successful Android developer, it’s essential to learn git because if you are doing an internship or job in a good company,  all the contributors contribute through version control. So this makes it mandatory to learn a version control system like git.
Database- You should know about working with Databases as an Android developer. To store data on the user’s phone, you will require to learn a database like Room or SQLite. If you want to host your app, Firebase is a perfect tool. I will recommend you to get a good enough knowledge of both these Databases.
Admob API- AdMob API can sometimes be a little complex; you will need to read its terms and condition. It would help if you so some research on its monetization programs before monetizing your application.
Building A Game- Most of the students are very curious about whether I can make games like PubG or GTA?
 The answer is Yes, you can, but you can't make it exactly the same as GTA and PubG. Making such an app would require a very high level of setup. You will need a different team for a specific task, but as a beginner undoubtedly you can make a similar game up to some extent. You will be needing a game engine for developing such a game. I will suggest you go for the Unity game engine and C# will be needed for the programming part.
Ds & Algo - As an Android Developer, data structures and algorithms is a very beneficial skill to have because you will be having clarity on what tasks require how much time. You can calculate time complexity, analyze various processes, etc. Having Ds Algo in your skillset is definitely a plus.
Conclusion
This was the complete roadmap that helps you become a pro in Android Development. I have mentioned all the points that were needed. All you have to do is add an ingredient in the hard work recipe, and the dish cooked from this recipe will perish you so much.

In this article, I will give you a detailed guide on installing WordPress on your local computer. Follow the steps below to install WordPress on your local computer :
To set up WordPress locally, you need three things :
MySQL: Database Management Software.
PHP: Programming Language
Apache: Web Server Software
It can be a very tedious task to install all of them one by one, especially for a beginner. That’s where Xampp comes into the picture. Xampp is a software package that mimics a complete environment that WordPress needs to function. Apart from this, you also need to download and install WordPress on your local computer. Let’s see how it’s done:
Download the Xampp from the official website of Apache Friends. Open the installer and keep clicking next to install Xampp in default settings.
The next thing that you need to install is WordPress. Click here to download WordPress.
Once you open wordpress.org, you will find a download WordPress button at the bottom of the page. Click it to start downloading WordPress, as shown below!
Once the download is finished, a zip file will be downloaded. Extract the contents of the zip file, and a folder named “WordPress” will be created as shown in the animation below :
Now, copy the WordPress folder and navigate to C://Xampp/
Paste the WordPress folder inside C://xampp/htdocs, as shown below. The ""htdocs"" folder contains all the websites that xampp will run:
Now, we need to start the Apache and MySQL module. Type “Xampp Control Panel” in the search bar of Windows 10 and open the Xampp application, as shown in the below animation.
Click on the start buttons in front of Apache and MySQL modules. You should see the status turn green after you start them.
The next thing that we need to do is to set up a database for our WordPress website. So, open your web browser and head over to localhost/phpmyadmin/
Now, click on “Databases” and create a new database with the name ""wordpress"".
Now head over to localhost/WordPress.
Enter the name of the database in which you want WordPress to save your data. In our case, it is “wordpress” because we created a database named wordpress in PHPMyAdmin.
Enter ‘root’ as the user name and leave the password blank. This is the default configuration of Xampp.
WordPress requires you to fill in some details like name, email address, user name, and password for your WordPress site. Fill in all the details correctly, and then click on the “Install WordPress” button.

That’s it! Congratulations on successfully installing WordPress on your local computer. I guarantee that if you’ve followed every step correctly, then you will get your WordPress installed within minutes. On logging in, you will see a beautiful but confusing dashboard for a beginner.

[Solved] gcc.exe error - No such file or directory gcc.exe: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated.,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/gcc-no-such-file-or-directory/,"One of my friends asked me how to solve this error:
gcc.exe: error: this.c: No such file or directory
gcc.exe: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
This error is pretty much saying that you have the gcc installed and working on your computer, but you don't have the file named this.c on this directory.
The presence of this error essentially means that you are in the wrong directory.
How to solve no such file or directory error in gcc
To get into the correct directory, all we need to do is use the cd command. Alternatively, you can navigate through windows explorer to get into the correct directory by following the steps below:
Step 1: Go to the location of the file you want to compile using gcc and press shift, and right-click at the same time.
You will now be offered a navigation menu like this:
Step 2: Click on the ""Open PowerShell window here"" option, and you will find the PowerShell window opened inside that directory
Step 3: Type gcc <filename.c> 
Since my filename is this.c I will type:
gcc this.c
Step 4: Type a.exe to execute your compiled program. Your program will compile and run, as shown below:
Conclusion
Hence we saw that ""No such file or directory gcc.exe: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated."" is not a problem with gcc or c installation but a problem with navigating into the correct directory.
I hope this post solved your issue. Let me know how the problem in your case occurred in the comments below!
Happy coding!

[Solved] Unable to start the C/C++ Language Server (Missing binary Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.exe),01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/c-cpp-extension-error-in-vs-code/,"I was working with a friend on a hobby project, and he suddenly encountered this weird error.
Unable to start the C/C++ language server. 
IntelliSense features will be disabled. 
Error: Missing binary at c:\Users\Harry\.vscode\extensions\ms-vscode.cpptools-1.1.3\bin\cpptools.exe
I am not a pro when it comes to VS Code errors, but still, I started thinking about a way to fix this issue. And yes, I succeeded in the end.
How to fix ""Unable to start the C/C++ Language Server (Missing binary Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.exe)"" error
You can fix this issue by deleting the extensions folder from whereever the C/C++ extension is installed. For example, my extension is installed at location: C:\Users\Harry\.vscode\extensions\ms-vscode.cpptools-1.1.3\bin\cpptools.exe
so I will delete ""C:\Users\Harry\.vscode\extensions\"" folder.
This will ensure that the extensions I have installed are deleted completely.
Now I will install the extensions afresh by going into the extensions tab, search for the C/C++ VS Code extension, and clicking install next to the C/C++ extension.
This will do the trick and install the VS Code Cpp extension without any errors!
  Notes
The steps I followed worked on my computer, but sometimes this might not work. In that case, you should delete the .vscode folder and reinstall VS Code from scratch.
If reinstalling doesn't work, try to install the ""user install version"" of VS Code (or Global System install version if you are already using the user version) because sometimes this might be due to the permissions issue!
If you are using an antivirus, temporarily disable it to check if it is a problem. Check if it is blocking VS Code or causing some issue with the extensions folders of VS Code.
Restart your pc to ensure some program or process is not accessing the extensions folder. Sometimes, a simple restart fixes complex issues!
If you had this issue and solved it using any of the methods above, let me know your experience.
Happy Coding!

Top 5 Programming Languages To Learn in 2021,01-07-2022,https://www.codewithharry.com/blogpost/top-programming-languages-2021/,"We all are aware of technology and its development at an alarming rate. It's prevalent to see one technology overpassing the other with great updations and developments. To keep ourselves in the field of technology, one thing always remains intact - learning a programming language.
Nowadays, the programming language is the basic building block of any technological development. It’s a pre-requisite of any major coding field. For example:- for machine learning, you need to learn languages like python, R, etc.; for web development, you need to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., and the list goes on. If you are in this field, you should not know just one programming language. At the same time, you don't want to be an excellent example of the famous saying, ""Jack of all trades master of none.""
To ensure that you are not a jack of all trades and a master of none, you should start by learning one language to perfection and developing a good command. You can then move forward to the next one and so on. In this way, you will gain good practical knowledge of different languages over time.
I know you must question that there are 1000+ languages; So should I learn all languages?
The answer is a big No! Learning a language depends upon the domain you are interested in.
But if you haven't decided on a domain yet, you are in a perfect place because I have created a list of the top 5 programming languages you should learn in 2021.
I have made this list with various online reports and surveys, such as the famous StackOverflow Developer Survey 2020.
Let's get started with the list of my language recommendations for 2021:
  1. Python
The canonical, ""Python is a great first language,"" elicited, ""Python is a great last language!""
The above phrase is justice to python. Python has been a scorching trending topic for the last few years, and it will surely be at the top of the hill in 2021.
But why? Why is python so famous? Or Is it hyped?
Python is very famous because of its easy syntax, which is very close to the natural language. Because of the ease of learning, it is very much loved by beginners as well as professionals.
In a StackOverflow developer survey, python is listed among the top loved programming languages.
Not only that, Python is extensively used in machine learning. According to the StackOverflow developer survey 2021, the machine learning job profile is also one of the highest paying jobs in recent years.
Python has excellent libraries like sci-kit learn, PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, Numpy, and many more, which makes machine learning very easy and fun at the same time. On top of that, Python has excellent community support and is supported by giants.
So starting to learn Python would be an excellent choice for you.
2. Javascript
""Javascript is the duct tape of the Internet.""
Charlie Campbell quoted the above line. Javascript has gained a lot of popularity in a shorter period. In the early 2000's big giants like Google, Microsoft started using JavaScript for the backend.
What makes javascript so famous?
JavaScript allows scalability needed in cloud computing and back-end programming. It has the feature to communicate with other languages and communicate with databases.
Due to its splendid features and significant usage, javascript has maintained its top position for the 8th year in a row.
If you are into the web development field, then javascript is of great use for you; along with HTML & CSS, you can develop unique projects as a beginner.
With javascript language, you can develop web applications, desktop apps, server backends, and mobile apps, which hardly any language provides.
  3. Java
We have often seen java losing its essence. However, when we look at the statistics, java is still among the top. It is still used by many big giants, which proves that language is always beneficial and in demand by the tech world.
The main advantage of java is that it provides security, unlike other languages.
Java runs on a virtual machine(JVM). It verifies the byte code and makes sure no unsafe operation is executed.
Other benefits of java include:
It's easy to learn
Object-oriented
Platform independent
If you want to learn android development, then java is a great language that you can look upon, and it's also an excellent language for a beginner to learn to program.
Let’s look up the ranking of java in the StackOverflow developer survey-
Around 40% of developers use java, which is more than 8 million developers. So learning java would give you a great start in your work because companies like Amazon, Adobe use java and provide excellent job offers for Java programmers.
Java has got generous community support, and its frameworks are prevalent. So if you want to learn java, you can go ahead. It will provide you with a promising career.
4. C/C++
The next programming language to learn in 2021 is everyone's favorite C/C++
C/C++ is like old wine, it never loses its place, and it gets more and more demand. It's another primary language in need for a very long time, and it will be in the market in the future.
It's a perfect language for beginners to start learning because it will help you understand computers' functionality. Not only that, some big firms provide a good package for c/c++ developers. As a beginner, learning DSA in C/C++ will be very beneficial to you.
The main advantage of C/C++ is its fast execution speed compared to python. If you want better use of your computer resources like game development, it's a great language.
And if you want to step into competitive programming, C/C++ is an excellent choice because its standard template library is fantastic!
More than 23% of developers use C/C++, so if you prepare for placement or internships, try this language and clear your concepts.
5. Dart
Dart was introduced on 10th October by two Google engineers at the goto conference as a new language designed to build web applications. It's a very young language, and it’s getting great popularity now!
DART is a flexible language; you can use dart with flutter to make a cross-platform application that can run on any device: iOS and Android. Dart embraced the open-source system, which helps it to achieve excellent community support also. It's pretty easy to learn and can be learned as a first language. Along with the clean & concise syntax, it's also got more productivity with the help of an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks packed with it.
Conclusion:
These were the top 5 programming languages that you can look upon to learn in 2021.
But if you want to learn another language in which you are comfortable, then stick to it, learn it and make a profitable career growth. What's important is to stick to a plan, make steady progressive steps, and achieve the ultimate goal.
