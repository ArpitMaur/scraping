Twitter 2.0: Our continued commitment to the public conversation
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 30 November 2022
Twitter’s mission is to promote and protect the public conversation--to be the town square of the internet. We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. 
We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today.
What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.
As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: 
First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.
Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.
When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. 
As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.
Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. 
We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.

Twitter’s curation program with AFP expands to LATAM, Spain, and the US
By
Twitter Latin America
Thursday, 27 October 2022
Estamos ampliando nuestros esfuerzos para identificar y elevar información creíble en Twitter.
It’s true: we’re expanding our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter.
Earlier this month, we told you about Twitter’s curation program with AFP in Brazil. This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. 
With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.
How and where does AFP curated content appear?
Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include:
Trends
Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels
Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. 
You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.
Adding helpful context to Twitter
Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal.
Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.

Wednesday, 26 October 2022
You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. 
There’s a reason for that. 
As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on.
Designing new sounds together
Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. 
Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:
Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities
Blending the organic and digital
Keeping sounds short and smooth
Attracting attention without being distracting
You can check some of them out for yourself below.

More sounds, and where to hear them
We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! 
Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps:
On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound. Toggle Sound Effects off
On Android: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display and languages > Display. Toggle Sound effects off"

A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 21 October 2022
Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it.
It’s true. 
Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. 
And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. 
A meme is (re)born
Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. 
To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013.
Who saw that coming?

People and brands get creative with mixed media
Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. 
People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it. 
Keep the creative ideas coming, and we’ll keep developing more ways to help you share them with the world.

Taylor Swift’s “Midnights” reveals how music fans show up on Twitter
By
Twitter Music
Thursday, 20 October 2022
Music is…kind of a big deal on Twitter.
Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. 
In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. 
And scroll down for updated numbers on how ""Swifties"" have responded to Midnights on Twitter.
The Swift Report
There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created.
Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.
😳😳😳
Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. 
Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).
Swifties' response to Midnights
The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. 
Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!
Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!
Music: The largest community on Twitter
It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter.
It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop.
So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released? Keep your eyes here to find out, and follow @TwitterMusic to keep up with what’s happening with your favorite artists, albums, and more!"

When natural disasters happen, Twitter can be used to help. Here’s how
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 13 October 2022
Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.
Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. 
To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.
Supporting preparedness and increasing awareness
It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies.
In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.
Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.
Andrew Coghlan
Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross
Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations  all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.
Sharing information and best practices
When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information.
In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis.
Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. 
This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.
Amplifying credible information using search prompts
When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. 
Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.
Organizing credible information in a centralized place
During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. 
In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.
In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.
Enabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools
There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. 
For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.
In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.
Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.  
We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.
The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q3 2022: Accessibility
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 11 October 2022
As the seasons begin to change around the world, we’ve been reflecting a lot on our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) journey at Twitter. The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles — and there have been plenty — you won’t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it’s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply –– about Twitter, and about each other. It’s what fuels the work, and it’s what drives us toward becoming the world’s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that’s never changing.
In fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn’t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we’re firm in where we’re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route.
So we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we’d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we’re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter — both the product and the workplace — that we love.
Let’s take a look…
Forming our Accessibility Center of Excellence
We recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE’s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter – in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.
In 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope — and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we’ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we’ve accomplished so far. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there’s much more to do.
Improving the way we work — a Global Accessibility Policy
This work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we’ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn’t been done before.
The Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities.
Here’s how:
At Twitter: The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities. These virtual and in-person experiences include recruitment, onboarding, meetings, career development tools, training, in our offices and more.
On Twitter: The planned policies will facilitate making our products, services, and communications (Tweets, marketing campaigns, etc.) accessible to people who use our service.
Commitment and action are critical to advancing this policy. This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:
IT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing.
People: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities.
Procurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities.
Product: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
We’re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs. We’ve signed the Procure Access statement as a step to advance technology accessibility in our company and throughout the world.
Through our internal and external partnerships, training programs, and best practices documentation, the Global Accessibility Policy will weave accessibility throughout our core business functions to increase efficiency and impact, without loss of velocity.
Continuing to learn — accessibility-focused courses
We’ve said it before: this work takes all of us. No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the “why” and the “how” behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter.
We built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally “101” content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding. To keep us accountable, the learnings are embedded in the roadmaps and goals of leaders across the business.  
Foundations of Accessibility: People come from different backgrounds and a variety of experiences and abilities. Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.
Disability Awareness: There’s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone — with or without a disability — who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.
Positive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.
And because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too. Take a look, and join in on the journey. 
Driving accessibility on our service
Leading with accessibility makes Twitter better. When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training. They also partner with our various Product teams to improve the accessibility of Twitter.
Since doubling down on our accessibility journey, we’ve made key updates on our service. Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We’ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide.
It’s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people. For the latest, follow @TwitterA11y and read more about our Accessibility features of Twitter.
All of us, together.
Our journey continues. Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don’t happen in vacuums. It’s why we don’t do this work in private or in silos. It’s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in — and learn.
Along with our progress, we’re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index.
People come to work at Twitter because they care. They care about the people and they care about the product. So whether you’re writing code, working on a marketing campaign, planning an event, designing a product feature, or hiring a candidate, you’re part of the work. Every Tweep is empowered to leverage available resources and be part of what makes us better. And the work won’t stop, #UntilWeAllBelong."
Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US,"Wednesday, 30 November 2022",https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/helpful-birdwatch-notes-now-visible-everyone-twitter-us,"Product
Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US
By
Community Notes
Thursday, 6 October 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.
Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US.
Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.
You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not.
Keeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone
Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service.
The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.
In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground.

@metaviv
Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. 
Expanding Birdwatch based on positive results
We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view.
According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.
We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. 
An open and transparent process
We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above. 
You can also keep up to date with all things Birdwatch by following our official @Birdwatch Twitter account, or click this link to apply to become a Birdwatch contributor and help improve the health of conversations on Twitter."

New video products make it easier to watch what’s happening on Twitter

Thursday, 29 September 2022
Videos are a huge part of the public conversation, and they’re one of the most engaging ways people can express themselves online. In fact, videos shared on Twitter receive billions of combined views every year (that’s billions with a “b”).
To help make it easier to find and watch what’s happening, we’re rolling out two new updates to how you experience videos on Twitter starting today. Here’s a quick look at what you can expect, and how to use them. 
Immersive viewing and easy discovery
Twitter’s updated immersive media viewer expands videos to full screen with a single click, allowing you to easily access the full, immersive viewing experience. To activate it, simply tap/click on a video in the Twitter app.

Twitter 2.0: Our continued commitment to the public conversation
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 30 November 2022
Twitter’s mission is to promote and protect the public conversation--to be the town square of the internet. We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. 
We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today.
What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.
As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: 
First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.
Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.
When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. 
As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.
Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. 
We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.

Twitter’s curation program with AFP expands to LATAM, Spain, and the US
By
Twitter Latin America
Thursday, 27 October 2022
Estamos ampliando nuestros esfuerzos para identificar y elevar información creíble en Twitter.
It’s true: we’re expanding our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter.
Earlier this month, we told you about Twitter’s curation program with AFP in Brazil. This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. 
With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.
How and where does AFP curated content appear?
Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include:
Trends
Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels
Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. 
You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.
Adding helpful context to Twitter
Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal.
Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.

Wednesday, 26 October 2022
You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. 
There’s a reason for that. 
As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on.
Designing new sounds together
Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. 
Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:
Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities
Blending the organic and digital
Keeping sounds short and smooth
Attracting attention without being distracting
You can check some of them out for yourself below.

More sounds, and where to hear them
We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! 
Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps:
On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound. Toggle Sound Effects off
On Android: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display and languages > Display. Toggle Sound effects off"

A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 21 October 2022
Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it.
It’s true. 
Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. 
And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. 
A meme is (re)born
Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. 
To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013.
Who saw that coming?

People and brands get creative with mixed media
Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. 
People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it. 
Keep the creative ideas coming, and we’ll keep developing more ways to help you share them with the world.

Taylor Swift’s “Midnights” reveals how music fans show up on Twitter
By
Twitter Music
Thursday, 20 October 2022
Music is…kind of a big deal on Twitter.
Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. 
In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. 
And scroll down for updated numbers on how ""Swifties"" have responded to Midnights on Twitter.
The Swift Report
There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created.
Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.
😳😳😳
Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. 
Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).
Swifties' response to Midnights
The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. 
Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!
Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!
Music: The largest community on Twitter
It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter.
It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop.
So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released? Keep your eyes here to find out, and follow @TwitterMusic to keep up with what’s happening with your favorite artists, albums, and more!"

When natural disasters happen, Twitter can be used to help. Here’s how
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 13 October 2022
Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.
Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. 
To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.
Supporting preparedness and increasing awareness
It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies.
In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.
Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.
Andrew Coghlan
Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross
Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations  all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.
Sharing information and best practices
When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information.
In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis.
Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. 
This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.
Amplifying credible information using search prompts
When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. 
Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.
Organizing credible information in a centralized place
During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. 
In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.
In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.
Enabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools
There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. 
For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.
In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.
Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.  
We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.
The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q3 2022: Accessibility
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 11 October 2022
As the seasons begin to change around the world, we’ve been reflecting a lot on our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) journey at Twitter. The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles — and there have been plenty — you won’t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it’s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply –– about Twitter, and about each other. It’s what fuels the work, and it’s what drives us toward becoming the world’s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that’s never changing.
In fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn’t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we’re firm in where we’re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route.
So we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we’d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we’re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter — both the product and the workplace — that we love.
Let’s take a look…
Forming our Accessibility Center of Excellence
We recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE’s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter – in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.
In 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope — and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we’ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we’ve accomplished so far. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there’s much more to do.
Improving the way we work — a Global Accessibility Policy
This work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we’ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn’t been done before.
The Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities.
Here’s how:
At Twitter: The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities. These virtual and in-person experiences include recruitment, onboarding, meetings, career development tools, training, in our offices and more.
On Twitter: The planned policies will facilitate making our products, services, and communications (Tweets, marketing campaigns, etc.) accessible to people who use our service.
Commitment and action are critical to advancing this policy. This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:
IT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing.
People: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities.
Procurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities.
Product: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
We’re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs. We’ve signed the Procure Access statement as a step to advance technology accessibility in our company and throughout the world.
Through our internal and external partnerships, training programs, and best practices documentation, the Global Accessibility Policy will weave accessibility throughout our core business functions to increase efficiency and impact, without loss of velocity.
Continuing to learn — accessibility-focused courses
We’ve said it before: this work takes all of us. No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the “why” and the “how” behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter.
We built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally “101” content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding. To keep us accountable, the learnings are embedded in the roadmaps and goals of leaders across the business.  
Foundations of Accessibility: People come from different backgrounds and a variety of experiences and abilities. Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.
Disability Awareness: There’s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone — with or without a disability — who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.
Positive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.
And because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too. Take a look, and join in on the journey. 
Driving accessibility on our service
Leading with accessibility makes Twitter better. When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training. They also partner with our various Product teams to improve the accessibility of Twitter.
Since doubling down on our accessibility journey, we’ve made key updates on our service. Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We’ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide.
It’s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people. For the latest, follow @TwitterA11y and read more about our Accessibility features of Twitter.
All of us, together.
Our journey continues. Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don’t happen in vacuums. It’s why we don’t do this work in private or in silos. It’s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in — and learn.
Along with our progress, we’re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index.
People come to work at Twitter because they care. They care about the people and they care about the product. So whether you’re writing code, working on a marketing campaign, planning an event, designing a product feature, or hiring a candidate, you’re part of the work. Every Tweep is empowered to leverage available resources and be part of what makes us better. And the work won’t stop, #UntilWeAllBelong."

Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US
By
Community Notes
Thursday, 6 October 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.
Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US.
Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.
You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not.
Keeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone
Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service.
The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.
In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground.

@metaviv
Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. 
Expanding Birdwatch based on positive results
We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view.
According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.
We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. 
An open and transparent process
We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

New video products make it easier to watch what’s happening on Twitter

Videos are a huge part of the public conversation, and they’re one of the most engaging ways people can express themselves online. In fact, videos shared on Twitter receive billions of combined views every year (that’s billions with a “b”).
To help make it easier to find and watch what’s happening, we’re rolling out two new updates to how you experience videos on Twitter starting today. Here’s a quick look at what you can expect, and how to use them. 
Immersive viewing and easy discovery
Twitter’s updated immersive media viewer expands videos to full screen with a single click, allowing you to easily access the full, immersive viewing experience. To activate it, simply tap/click on a video in the Twitter app.
Once the video has been launched in full screen mode, we’ve made video discovery easier as well. Just scroll up to start browsing more engaging video content. If you want to exit the viewer and go back to the original Tweet, click the back arrow in the top left corner.
Our immersive media viewer will be available in the coming days to people using Twitter in English on iOS.
Showing more videos in Explore
Say hello to the newest addition to Twitter’s Explore tab. 
With our new video carousel, you can now easily find more videos you like alongside Tweets and Trends that might interest you. Just open the Explore tab to discover some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter. 
The video carousel is currently available to people in select countries using Twitter in English on iOS and Android.
Making Twitter the best place for video 
We want to make it easy for everyone to use our service in the way that best fits their needs, and videos (including fun movie teasers) an important part of that.
Keep your eyes on Twitter for more updates on how we’re working to improve your media experience."

Twitter 2.0: Our continued commitment to the public conversation
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 30 November 2022
Twitter’s mission is to promote and protect the public conversation--to be the town square of the internet. We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. 
We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today.
What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.
As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: 
First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.
Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.
When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. 
As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.
Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. 
We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.

Twitter’s curation program with AFP expands to LATAM, Spain, and the US
By
Twitter Latin America
Thursday, 27 October 2022
Estamos ampliando nuestros esfuerzos para identificar y elevar información creíble en Twitter.
It’s true: we’re expanding our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter.
Earlier this month, we told you about Twitter’s curation program with AFP in Brazil. This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. 
With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.
How and where does AFP curated content appear?
Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include:
Trends
Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels
Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. 
You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.
Adding helpful context to Twitter
Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal.
Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.

Wednesday, 26 October 2022
You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. 
There’s a reason for that. 
As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on.
Designing new sounds together
Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. 
Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:
Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities
Blending the organic and digital
Keeping sounds short and smooth
Attracting attention without being distracting
You can check some of them out for yourself below.

More sounds, and where to hear them
We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! 
Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps:
On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound. Toggle Sound Effects off
On Android: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display and languages > Display. Toggle Sound effects off"

A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 21 October 2022
Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it.
It’s true. 
Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. 
And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. 
A meme is (re)born
Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. 
To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013.
Who saw that coming?

People and brands get creative with mixed media
Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. 
People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it. 
Keep the creative ideas coming, and we’ll keep developing more ways to help you share them with the world.

Taylor Swift’s “Midnights” reveals how music fans show up on Twitter
By
Twitter Music
Thursday, 20 October 2022
Music is…kind of a big deal on Twitter.
Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. 
In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. 
And scroll down for updated numbers on how ""Swifties"" have responded to Midnights on Twitter.
The Swift Report
There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created.
Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.
😳😳😳
Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. 
Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).
Swifties' response to Midnights
The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. 
Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!
Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!
Music: The largest community on Twitter
It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter.
It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop.
So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released? Keep your eyes here to find out, and follow @TwitterMusic to keep up with what’s happening with your favorite artists, albums, and more!"

When natural disasters happen, Twitter can be used to help. Here’s how
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 13 October 2022
Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.
Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. 
To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.
Supporting preparedness and increasing awareness
It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies.
In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.
Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.
Andrew Coghlan
Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross
Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations  all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.
Sharing information and best practices
When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information.
In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis.
Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. 
This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.
Amplifying credible information using search prompts
When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. 
Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.
Organizing credible information in a centralized place
During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. 
In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.
In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.
Enabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools
There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. 
For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.
In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.
Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.  
We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.
The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q3 2022: Accessibility
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 11 October 2022
As the seasons begin to change around the world, we’ve been reflecting a lot on our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) journey at Twitter. The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles — and there have been plenty — you won’t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it’s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply –– about Twitter, and about each other. It’s what fuels the work, and it’s what drives us toward becoming the world’s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that’s never changing.
In fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn’t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we’re firm in where we’re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route.
So we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we’d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we’re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter — both the product and the workplace — that we love.
Let’s take a look…
Forming our Accessibility Center of Excellence
We recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE’s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter – in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.
In 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope — and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we’ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we’ve accomplished so far. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there’s much more to do.
Improving the way we work — a Global Accessibility Policy
This work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we’ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn’t been done before.
The Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities.
Here’s how:
At Twitter: The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities. These virtual and in-person experiences include recruitment, onboarding, meetings, career development tools, training, in our offices and more.
On Twitter: The planned policies will facilitate making our products, services, and communications (Tweets, marketing campaigns, etc.) accessible to people who use our service.
Commitment and action are critical to advancing this policy. This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:
IT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing.
People: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities.
Procurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities.
Product: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
We’re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs. We’ve signed the Procure Access statement as a step to advance technology accessibility in our company and throughout the world.
Through our internal and external partnerships, training programs, and best practices documentation, the Global Accessibility Policy will weave accessibility throughout our core business functions to increase efficiency and impact, without loss of velocity.
Continuing to learn — accessibility-focused courses
We’ve said it before: this work takes all of us. No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the “why” and the “how” behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter.
We built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally “101” content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding. To keep us accountable, the learnings are embedded in the roadmaps and goals of leaders across the business.  
Foundations of Accessibility: People come from different backgrounds and a variety of experiences and abilities. Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.
Disability Awareness: There’s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone — with or without a disability — who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.
Positive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.
And because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too. Take a look, and join in on the journey. 
Driving accessibility on our service
Leading with accessibility makes Twitter better. When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training. They also partner with our various Product teams to improve the accessibility of Twitter.
Since doubling down on our accessibility journey, we’ve made key updates on our service. Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We’ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide.
It’s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people. For the latest, follow @TwitterA11y and read more about our Accessibility features of Twitter.
All of us, together.
Our journey continues. Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don’t happen in vacuums. It’s why we don’t do this work in private or in silos. It’s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in — and learn.
Along with our progress, we’re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index.
People come to work at Twitter because they care. They care about the people and they care about the product. So whether you’re writing code, working on a marketing campaign, planning an event, designing a product feature, or hiring a candidate, you’re part of the work. Every Tweep is empowered to leverage available resources and be part of what makes us better. And the work won’t stop, #UntilWeAllBelong."

Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US
By
Community Notes
Thursday, 6 October 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.
Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US.
Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.
You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not.
Keeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone
Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service.
The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.
In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground.

@metaviv
Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. 
Expanding Birdwatch based on positive results
We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view.
According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.
We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. 
An open and transparent process
We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above. 
You can also keep up to date with all things Birdwatch by following our official @Birdwatch Twitter account, or click this link to apply to become a Birdwatch contributor and help improve the health of conversations on Twitter."

Videos are a huge part of the public conversation, and they’re one of the most engaging ways people can express themselves online. In fact, videos shared on Twitter receive billions of combined views every year (that’s billions with a “b”).
To help make it easier to find and watch what’s happening, we’re rolling out two new updates to how you experience videos on Twitter starting today. Here’s a quick look at what you can expect, and how to use them. 
Immersive viewing and easy discovery
Twitter’s updated immersive media viewer expands videos to full screen with a single click, allowing you to easily access the full, immersive viewing experience. To activate it, simply tap/click on a video in the Twitter app.
Once the video has been launched in full screen mode, we’ve made video discovery easier as well. Just scroll up to start browsing more engaging video content. If you want to exit the viewer and go back to the original Tweet, click the back arrow in the top left corner.
Our immersive media viewer will be available in the coming days to people using Twitter in English on iOS.
Showing more videos in Explore
Say hello to the newest addition to Twitter’s Explore tab. 
With our new video carousel, you can now easily find more videos you like alongside Tweets and Trends that might interest you. Just open the Explore tab to discover some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter. 
The video carousel is currently available to people in select countries using Twitter in English on iOS and Android.
Making Twitter the best place for video 
We want to make it easy for everyone to use our service in the way that best fits their needs, and videos (including fun movie teasers) an important part of that.
Keep your eyes on Twitter for more updates on how we’re working to improve your media experience."

Our approach to the 2022 elections in Brazil and partnership with AFP
By
Twitter Brasil
Wednesday, 28 September 2022
The Brazilian presidential elections are happening, and Twitter is working to encourage safe and informed civic participation.
To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more.
Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil.
Seeing what’s happening in the elections
Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. 
The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place.
We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account.
Focusing on civic integrity
Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts.
With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:
Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them
That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election
That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions
Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.
It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.
Keeping people informed
To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources.
We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more.
Curating reliable content
We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area.
Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period.
Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media.
Encouraging participation in the conversation
We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. 
To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used.
We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. 
Beyond the elections: Twitter’s partnership with AFP
Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. 
That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include:
Trends
The Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels

The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium is now open to researchers
By
Yoel Roth
Thursday, 22 September 2022
Twitter is committed to data-driven transparency. 
In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. 
These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.
Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.
How to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium
Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. 
We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. 
Why is transparency such a priority at Twitter?
Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. 
By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.
For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. 
Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. 
Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."

How recommendations help you discover more on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 20 September 2022
Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. 
If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.
Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).
If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them.
How and where Twitter recommends content
The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals.
Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. 
Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.
Maintaining a high standard for recommendations
Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic.
Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. 
Controlling your recommendations
In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. 
One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. 
You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content.
How we’re Improving recommendations
Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. 
This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t.
With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. 
We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."

Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. 
That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. 
Here’s how it works — and why it’s important.
Activating Twitter’s new image description reminder
Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter.
Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image.
We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:
Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder
Why is it important to add image descriptions? 
Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. 
Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: 
“An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.”
You can read more about how to write great image descriptions.
Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.
Improving accessibility at Twitter
Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets.
This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. 
In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.
You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."

Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 16 September 2022
Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter.
From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most.
And the summer of 2022 has been no different.
September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter.
Music
In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album.
K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views.
And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday?
Movies and TV
When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. 
Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther?
Current Events
The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling.
Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral.
Sports
The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. 
And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter.
In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan.
And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever.
We come together on Twitter
These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

How many people come to Twitter for news? As it turns out, a LOT
By
Twitter News
Monday, 12 September 2022
People come to Twitter for many reasons. As it turns out, one of the biggest is to stay informed about current events.
Whether it’s politics, world & local news, entertainment, sports, technology, or health & wellness, Twitter has become home to some of the most relevant conversations about news and current events happening around the world.
Why is this important information to know? First, it helps us understand and better serve people’s interests. Second, it reinforces the importance of the work we’re doing to address misinformation, add helpful context to Tweets, and keep people better informed about the news they consume on Twitter.
To help give you visibility into some of these findings, we’ve compiled learnings from studies Twitter has performed with YouGov and Sparkler, as well as internal Twitter data and third party research from groups like YouGov and Pew Research. Unless otherwise noted, these studies and surveys have been conducted with respondents in the US. 
Read on to learn more about the ways people engage with current events on Twitter.

Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes,"Wednesday, 30 November 2022",https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/birdwatch-getting-new-onboarding-process-more-visible-notes,"Product
Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 7 September 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed.
As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter.
The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. 
Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.
A better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch
We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way.
New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.
Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability.
*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.
Expanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes
With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. 
We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. 
The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. 
Understanding the impact of Birdwatch
Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter.
According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. 
This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

Thursday, 1 September 2022
The screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That’s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon (like the one at the bottom of this article).
It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks.
Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited.
What is Edit Tweet?
So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.
For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet.
For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.
Who will be testing Edit Tweet?
Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful.
Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter.
The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.
Participating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you
We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.
Turn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we’ll have more to share soon!"

Introducing Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 30 August 2022
Sometimes you just want to talk to your people. That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. 
With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers.
We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.
Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. 
Selecting your circle
Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. 
Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. 
You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. 
Personalizing your Twitter experience
We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction.
Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:
Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves
Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts
Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends
Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings
I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.

I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!

Some results from our Twitter Circle test include:
Increased overall Tweeting 
Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)
Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.
LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

Twitter 2.0: Our continued commitment to the public conversation
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 30 November 2022
Twitter’s mission is to promote and protect the public conversation--to be the town square of the internet. We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. 
We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today.
What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.
As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: 
First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.
Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.
When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. 
As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.
Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. 
We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.

Twitter’s curation program with AFP expands to LATAM, Spain, and the US
By
Twitter Latin America
Thursday, 27 October 2022
Estamos ampliando nuestros esfuerzos para identificar y elevar información creíble en Twitter.
It’s true: we’re expanding our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter.
Earlier this month, we told you about Twitter’s curation program with AFP in Brazil. This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. 
With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.
How and where does AFP curated content appear?
Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include:
Trends
Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels
Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. 
You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.
Adding helpful context to Twitter
Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal.
Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.

Wednesday, 26 October 2022
You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. 
There’s a reason for that. 
As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on.
Designing new sounds together
Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. 
Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:
Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities
Blending the organic and digital
Keeping sounds short and smooth
Attracting attention without being distracting
You can check some of them out for yourself below.

More sounds, and where to hear them
We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! 
Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps:
On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound. Toggle Sound Effects off
On Android: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display and languages > Display. Toggle Sound effects off"

A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 21 October 2022
Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it.
It’s true. 
Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. 
And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. 
A meme is (re)born
Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. 
To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013.
Who saw that coming?

People and brands get creative with mixed media
Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. 
People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it. 
Keep the creative ideas coming, and we’ll keep developing more ways to help you share them with the world.

Taylor Swift’s “Midnights” reveals how music fans show up on Twitter
By
Twitter Music
Thursday, 20 October 2022
Music is…kind of a big deal on Twitter.
Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. 
In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. 
And scroll down for updated numbers on how ""Swifties"" have responded to Midnights on Twitter.
The Swift Report
There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created.
Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.
😳😳😳
Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. 
Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).
Swifties' response to Midnights
The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. 
Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!
Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!
Music: The largest community on Twitter
It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter.
It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop.
So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released? Keep your eyes here to find out, and follow @TwitterMusic to keep up with what’s happening with your favorite artists, albums, and more!"

When natural disasters happen, Twitter can be used to help. Here’s how
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 13 October 2022
Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.
Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. 
To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.
Supporting preparedness and increasing awareness
It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies.
In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.
Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.
Andrew Coghlan
Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross
Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations  all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.
Sharing information and best practices
When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information.
In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis.
Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. 
This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.
Amplifying credible information using search prompts
When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. 
Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.
Organizing credible information in a centralized place
During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. 
In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.
In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.
Enabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools
There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. 
For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.
In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.
Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.  
We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.
The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q3 2022: Accessibility
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 11 October 2022
As the seasons begin to change around the world, we’ve been reflecting a lot on our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) journey at Twitter. The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles — and there have been plenty — you won’t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it’s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply –– about Twitter, and about each other. It’s what fuels the work, and it’s what drives us toward becoming the world’s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that’s never changing.
In fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn’t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we’re firm in where we’re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route.
So we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we’d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we’re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter — both the product and the workplace — that we love.
Let’s take a look…
Forming our Accessibility Center of Excellence
We recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE’s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter – in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.
In 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope — and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we’ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we’ve accomplished so far. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there’s much more to do.
Improving the way we work — a Global Accessibility Policy
This work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we’ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn’t been done before.
The Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities.
Here’s how:
At Twitter: The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities. These virtual and in-person experiences include recruitment, onboarding, meetings, career development tools, training, in our offices and more.
On Twitter: The planned policies will facilitate making our products, services, and communications (Tweets, marketing campaigns, etc.) accessible to people who use our service.
Commitment and action are critical to advancing this policy. This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:
IT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing.
People: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities.
Procurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities.
Product: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
We’re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs. We’ve signed the Procure Access statement as a step to advance technology accessibility in our company and throughout the world.
Through our internal and external partnerships, training programs, and best practices documentation, the Global Accessibility Policy will weave accessibility throughout our core business functions to increase efficiency and impact, without loss of velocity.
Continuing to learn — accessibility-focused courses
We’ve said it before: this work takes all of us. No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the “why” and the “how” behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter.
We built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally “101” content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding. To keep us accountable, the learnings are embedded in the roadmaps and goals of leaders across the business.  
Foundations of Accessibility: People come from different backgrounds and a variety of experiences and abilities. Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.
Disability Awareness: There’s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone — with or without a disability — who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.
Positive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.
And because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too. Take a look, and join in on the journey. 
Driving accessibility on our service
Leading with accessibility makes Twitter better. When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training. They also partner with our various Product teams to improve the accessibility of Twitter.
Since doubling down on our accessibility journey, we’ve made key updates on our service. Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We’ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide.
It’s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people. For the latest, follow @TwitterA11y and read more about our Accessibility features of Twitter.
All of us, together.
Our journey continues. Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don’t happen in vacuums. It’s why we don’t do this work in private or in silos. It’s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in — and learn.
Along with our progress, we’re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index.
People come to work at Twitter because they care. They care about the people and they care about the product. So whether you’re writing code, working on a marketing campaign, planning an event, designing a product feature, or hiring a candidate, you’re part of the work. Every Tweep is empowered to leverage available resources and be part of what makes us better. And the work won’t stop, #UntilWeAllBelong."

Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US
By
Community Notes
Thursday, 6 October 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.
Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US.
Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.
You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not.
Keeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone
Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service.
The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.
In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground.

Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. 
Expanding Birdwatch based on positive results
We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view.
According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.
We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. 
An open and transparent process
We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above. 
You can also keep up to date with all things Birdwatch by following our official @Birdwatch Twitter account, or click this link to apply to become a Birdwatch contributor and help improve the health of conversations on Twitter."

Videos are a huge part of the public conversation, and they’re one of the most engaging ways people can express themselves online. In fact, videos shared on Twitter receive billions of combined views every year (that’s billions with a “b”).
To help make it easier to find and watch what’s happening, we’re rolling out two new updates to how you experience videos on Twitter starting today. Here’s a quick look at what you can expect, and how to use them. 
Immersive viewing and easy discovery
Twitter’s updated immersive media viewer expands videos to full screen with a single click, allowing you to easily access the full, immersive viewing experience. To activate it, simply tap/click on a video in the Twitter app.
Once the video has been launched in full screen mode, we’ve made video discovery easier as well. Just scroll up to start browsing more engaging video content. If you want to exit the viewer and go back to the original Tweet, click the back arrow in the top left corner.
Our immersive media viewer will be available in the coming days to people using Twitter in English on iOS.
Showing more videos in Explore
Say hello to the newest addition to Twitter’s Explore tab. 
With our new video carousel, you can now easily find more videos you like alongside Tweets and Trends that might interest you. Just open the Explore tab to discover some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter. 
The video carousel is currently available to people in select countries using Twitter in English on iOS and Android.
Making Twitter the best place for video 
We want to make it easy for everyone to use our service in the way that best fits their needs, and videos (including fun movie teasers) an important part of that.
Keep your eyes on Twitter for more updates on how we’re working to improve your media experience."

Our approach to the 2022 elections in Brazil and partnership with AFP
By
Twitter Brasil
Wednesday, 28 September 2022
The Brazilian presidential elections are happening, and Twitter is working to encourage safe and informed civic participation.
To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more.
Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil.
Seeing what’s happening in the elections
Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. 
The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place.
We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account.
Focusing on civic integrity
Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts.
With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:
Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them
That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election
That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions
Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.
It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.
Keeping people informed
To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources.
We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more.
Curating reliable content
We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area.
Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period.
Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media.
Encouraging participation in the conversation
We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. 
To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used.
We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. 
Beyond the elections: Twitter’s partnership with AFP
Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. 
That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include:
Trends
The Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels

The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium is now open to researchers
By
Yoel Roth
Thursday, 22 September 2022
Twitter is committed to data-driven transparency. 
In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. 
These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.
Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.
How to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium
Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. 
We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. 
Why is transparency such a priority at Twitter?
Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. 
By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.
For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. 
Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. 
Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."

How recommendations help you discover more on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 20 September 2022
Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. 
If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.
Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).
If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them.
How and where Twitter recommends content
The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals.
Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. 
Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.
Maintaining a high standard for recommendations
Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic.
Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. 
Controlling your recommendations
In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. 
One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. 
You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content.
How we’re Improving recommendations
Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. 
This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t.
With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. 
We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."

Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. 
That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. 
Here’s how it works — and why it’s important.
Activating Twitter’s new image description reminder
Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter.
Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image.
We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:
Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder
Why is it important to add image descriptions? 
Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. 
Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: 
“An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.”
You can read more about how to write great image descriptions.
Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.
Improving accessibility at Twitter
Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets.
This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. 
In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.
You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."

Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 16 September 2022
Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter.
From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most.
And the summer of 2022 has been no different.
September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter.
Music
In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album.
K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views.
And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday?
Movies and TV
When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. 
Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther?
Current Events
The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling.
Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral.
Sports
The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. 
And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter.
In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan.
And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever.
We come together on Twitter
These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

How many people come to Twitter for news? As it turns out, a LOT
By
Twitter News
Monday, 12 September 2022
People come to Twitter for many reasons. As it turns out, one of the biggest is to stay informed about current events.
Whether it’s politics, world & local news, entertainment, sports, technology, or health & wellness, Twitter has become home to some of the most relevant conversations about news and current events happening around the world.
Why is this important information to know? First, it helps us understand and better serve people’s interests. Second, it reinforces the importance of the work we’re doing to address misinformation, add helpful context to Tweets, and keep people better informed about the news they consume on Twitter.
To help give you visibility into some of these findings, we’ve compiled learnings from studies Twitter has performed with YouGov and Sparkler, as well as internal Twitter data and third party research from groups like YouGov and Pew Research. Unless otherwise noted, these studies and surveys have been conducted with respondents in the US.

Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 7 September 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed.
As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter.
The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. 
Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.
A better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch
We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way.
New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.
Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability.
*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.
Expanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes
With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. 
We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. 
The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. 
Understanding the impact of Birdwatch
Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter.
According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. 
This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

Thursday, 1 September 2022
The screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That’s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon (like the one at the bottom of this article).
It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks.
Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited.
What is Edit Tweet?
So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.
For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet.
For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.
Who will be testing Edit Tweet?
Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful.
Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter.
The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.
Participating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you
We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.
Turn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we’ll have more to share soon!"

Introducing Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 30 August 2022
Sometimes you just want to talk to your people. That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. 
With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers.
We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.
Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. 
Selecting your circle
Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. 
Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. 
You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. 
Personalizing your Twitter experience
We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction.
Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:
Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves
Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts
Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends
Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings
I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.

@itszaeok
I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!

Some results from our Twitter Circle test include:
Increased overall Tweeting 
Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)
Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.
LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

Our approach to the 2022 elections in Brazil and partnership with AFP
By
Twitter Brasil
Wednesday, 28 September 2022
The Brazilian presidential elections are happening, and Twitter is working to encourage safe and informed civic participation.
To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more.
Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil.
Seeing what’s happening in the elections
Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. 
The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place.
We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account.
Focusing on civic integrity
Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts.
With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:
Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them
That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election
That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions
Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.
It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.
Keeping people informed
To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources.
We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more.
Curating reliable content
We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area.
Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period.
Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media.
Encouraging participation in the conversation
We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. 
To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used.
We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. 
Beyond the elections: Twitter’s partnership with AFP
Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. 
That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include:
Trends
The Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels

The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium is now open to researchers
By
Yoel Roth
Thursday, 22 September 2022
Twitter is committed to data-driven transparency. 
In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. 
These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.
Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.
How to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium
Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. 
We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. 
Why is transparency such a priority at Twitter?
Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. 
By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.
For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. 
Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. 
Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."

How recommendations help you discover more on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 20 September 2022
Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. 
If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.
Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).
If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them.
How and where Twitter recommends content
The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals.
Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. 
Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.
Maintaining a high standard for recommendations
Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic.
Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. 
Controlling your recommendations
In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. 
One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. 
You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content.
How we’re Improving recommendations
Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. 
This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t.
With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. 
We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."

Twitter Accessibility
Monday, 19 September 2022
Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. 
That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. 
Here’s how it works — and why it’s important.
Activating Twitter’s new image description reminder
Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter.
Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image.
We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:
Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder
Why is it important to add image descriptions? 
Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. 
Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: 
“An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.”
You can read more about how to write great image descriptions.
Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.
Improving accessibility at Twitter
Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets.
This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. 
In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.
You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."

Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter
By

Friday, 16 September 2022
Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter.
From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most.
And the summer of 2022 has been no different.
September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter.
Music
In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album.
K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views.
And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday?
Movies and TV
When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. 
Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther?
Current Events
The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling.
Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral.
Sports
The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. 
And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter.
In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan.
And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever.
We come together on Twitter
These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

How many people come to Twitter for news? As it turns out, a LOT
By
Twitter News
Monday, 12 September 2022
People come to Twitter for many reasons. As it turns out, one of the biggest is to stay informed about current events.
Whether it’s politics, world & local news, entertainment, sports, technology, or health & wellness, Twitter has become home to some of the most relevant conversations about news and current events happening around the world.
Why is this important information to know? First, it helps us understand and better serve people’s interests. Second, it reinforces the importance of the work we’re doing to address misinformation, add helpful context to Tweets, and keep people better informed about the news they consume on Twitter.
To help give you visibility into some of these findings, we’ve compiled learnings from studies Twitter has performed with YouGov and Sparkler, as well as internal Twitter data and third party research from groups like YouGov and Pew Research. Unless otherwise noted, these studies and surveys have been conducted with respondents in the US. 
Read on to learn more about the ways people engage with current events on Twitter.

Serena Williams has been a dominant force on the tennis court for 27 years — and while Twitter hasn’t been around quite that long, she continues to rack up the W’s here as well.
Last week, in addition to shattering ESPN’s all-time tennis viewership record during her farewell match at the US Open, Serena was officially crowned the most Tweeted about female athlete of all time.
It’s true. During the course of 2022's US Open alone, she’s been mentioned in over a million Tweets and counting. Here are some more stats you might be interested to know:
Serena has over 10.7 million Twitter followers and still ranks among the top 20 female athletes with the most new followers in 2021 — more than two decades after her career began
@serenawilliams is the most mentioned player handle in the tennis conversation globally since the start of the US Open
All of the top 5 most Retweeted Tweets about tennis since the start of US Open are about Serena
Serena continues to bring new audiences to tennis, with approximately 30% of users who Tweeted about Serena in August having not Tweeted about tennis all year 
We just wanted to give credit where credit’s due. Here’s to 367 major match victories, 23 Grand Slam singles championships, 4 gold medals and countless memories.

As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed.
As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter.
The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. 
Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.
A better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch
We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way.
New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.
Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability.
*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.
Expanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes
With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. 
We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. 
The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. 
Understanding the impact of Birdwatch
Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter.
According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. 
This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

This is a test of Twitter’s new Edit Tweet feature. This is only a test
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 1 September 2022
The screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That’s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon (like the one at the bottom of this article).
It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks.
Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited.
What is Edit Tweet?
So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.
For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet.
For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.
Who will be testing Edit Tweet?
Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful.
Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter.
The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.
Participating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you
We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.
Turn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we’ll have more to share soon!"

Introducing Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 30 August 2022
Sometimes you just want to talk to your people. That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. 
With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers.
We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.
Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. 
Selecting your circle
Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. 
Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. 
You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. 
Personalizing your Twitter experience
We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction.
Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:
Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves
Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts
Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends
Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings
I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.

@itszaeok
I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!

Some results from our Twitter Circle test include:
Increased overall Tweeting 
Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)
Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.
LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

Twitter 2.0: Our continued commitment to the public conversation
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 30 November 2022
Twitter’s mission is to promote and protect the public conversation--to be the town square of the internet. We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. 
We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today.
What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.
As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: 
First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.
Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.
When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. 
As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.
Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. 
We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.

Twitter’s curation program with AFP expands to LATAM, Spain, and the US
By
Twitter Latin America
Thursday, 27 October 2022
Estamos ampliando nuestros esfuerzos para identificar y elevar información creíble en Twitter.
It’s true: we’re expanding our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter.
Earlier this month, we told you about Twitter’s curation program with AFP in Brazil. This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. 
With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.
How and where does AFP curated content appear?
Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include:
Trends
Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels
Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. 
You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.
Adding helpful context to Twitter
Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal.
Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.

Wednesday, 26 October 2022
You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. 
There’s a reason for that. 
As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on.
Designing new sounds together
Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. 
Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:
Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities
Blending the organic and digital
Keeping sounds short and smooth
Attracting attention without being distracting
You can check some of them out for yourself below.

More sounds, and where to hear them
We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! 
Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps:
On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound. Toggle Sound Effects off
On Android: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display and languages > Display. Toggle Sound effects off"

A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 21 October 2022
Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it.
It’s true. 
Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. 
And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. 
A meme is (re)born
Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. 
To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013.
Who saw that coming?

People and brands get creative with mixed media
Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. 
People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it. 
Keep the creative ideas coming, and we’ll keep developing more ways to help you share them with the world.

Taylor Swift’s “Midnights” reveals how music fans show up on Twitter
By
Twitter Music
Thursday, 20 October 2022
Music is…kind of a big deal on Twitter.
Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. 
In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. 
And scroll down for updated numbers on how ""Swifties"" have responded to Midnights on Twitter.
The Swift Report
There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created.
Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.
😳😳😳
Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. 
Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).
Swifties' response to Midnights
The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. 
Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!
Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!
Music: The largest community on Twitter
It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter.
It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop.
So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released? Keep your eyes here to find out, and follow @TwitterMusic to keep up with what’s happening with your favorite artists, albums, and more!"

When natural disasters happen, Twitter can be used to help. Here’s how
By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 13 October 2022
Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.
Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. 
To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.
Supporting preparedness and increasing awareness
It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies.
In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.
Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.
Andrew Coghlan
Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross
Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations  all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.
Sharing information and best practices
When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information.
In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis.
Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. 
This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.
Amplifying credible information using search prompts
When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. 
Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.
Organizing credible information in a centralized place
During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. 
In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.
In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.
Enabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools
There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. 
For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.
In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.
Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.  
We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.
The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q3 2022: Accessibility
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 11 October 2022
As the seasons begin to change around the world, we’ve been reflecting a lot on our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) journey at Twitter. The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles — and there have been plenty — you won’t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it’s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply –– about Twitter, and about each other. It’s what fuels the work, and it’s what drives us toward becoming the world’s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that’s never changing.
In fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn’t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we’re firm in where we’re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route.
So we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we’d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we’re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter — both the product and the workplace — that we love.
Let’s take a look…
Forming our Accessibility Center of Excellence
We recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE’s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter – in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.
In 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope — and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we’ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we’ve accomplished so far. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there’s much more to do.
Improving the way we work — a Global Accessibility Policy
This work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we’ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn’t been done before.
The Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities.
Here’s how:
At Twitter: The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities. These virtual and in-person experiences include recruitment, onboarding, meetings, career development tools, training, in our offices and more.
On Twitter: The planned policies will facilitate making our products, services, and communications (Tweets, marketing campaigns, etc.) accessible to people who use our service.
Commitment and action are critical to advancing this policy. This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:
IT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing.
People: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities.
Procurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities.
Product: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
We’re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs. We’ve signed the Procure Access statement as a step to advance technology accessibility in our company and throughout the world.
Through our internal and external partnerships, training programs, and best practices documentation, the Global Accessibility Policy will weave accessibility throughout our core business functions to increase efficiency and impact, without loss of velocity.
Continuing to learn — accessibility-focused courses
We’ve said it before: this work takes all of us. No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the “why” and the “how” behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter.
We built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally “101” content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding. To keep us accountable, the learnings are embedded in the roadmaps and goals of leaders across the business.  
Foundations of Accessibility: People come from different backgrounds and a variety of experiences and abilities. Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.
Disability Awareness: There’s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone — with or without a disability — who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.
Positive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.
And because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too. Take a look, and join in on the journey. 
Driving accessibility on our service
Leading with accessibility makes Twitter better. When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training. They also partner with our various Product teams to improve the accessibility of Twitter.
Since doubling down on our accessibility journey, we’ve made key updates on our service. Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We’ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide.
It’s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people. For the latest, follow @TwitterA11y and read more about our Accessibility features of Twitter.
All of us, together.
Our journey continues. Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don’t happen in vacuums. It’s why we don’t do this work in private or in silos. It’s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in — and learn.
Along with our progress, we’re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index.
People come to work at Twitter because they care. They care about the people and they care about the product. So whether you’re writing code, working on a marketing campaign, planning an event, designing a product feature, or hiring a candidate, you’re part of the work. Every Tweep is empowered to leverage available resources and be part of what makes us better. And the work won’t stop, #UntilWeAllBelong."

Helpful Birdwatch notes are now visible to everyone on Twitter in the US
By
Community Notes
Thursday, 6 October 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.
Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US.
Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.
You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not.
Keeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone
Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service.
The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.
In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground.

Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. 
Expanding Birdwatch based on positive results
We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view.
According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.
We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. 
An open and transparent process
We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above. 
You can also keep up to date with all things Birdwatch by following our official @Birdwatch Twitter account, or click this link to apply to become a Birdwatch contributor and help improve the health of conversations on Twitter."

Thursday, 29 September 2022
Videos are a huge part of the public conversation, and they’re one of the most engaging ways people can express themselves online. In fact, videos shared on Twitter receive billions of combined views every year (that’s billions with a “b”).
To help make it easier to find and watch what’s happening, we’re rolling out two new updates to how you experience videos on Twitter starting today. Here’s a quick look at what you can expect, and how to use them. 
Immersive viewing and easy discovery
Twitter’s updated immersive media viewer expands videos to full screen with a single click, allowing you to easily access the full, immersive viewing experience. To activate it, simply tap/click on a video in the Twitter app.
Once the video has been launched in full screen mode, we’ve made video discovery easier as well. Just scroll up to start browsing more engaging video content. If you want to exit the viewer and go back to the original Tweet, click the back arrow in the top left corner.
Our immersive media viewer will be available in the coming days to people using Twitter in English on iOS.
Showing more videos in Explore
Say hello to the newest addition to Twitter’s Explore tab. 
With our new video carousel, you can now easily find more videos you like alongside Tweets and Trends that might interest you. Just open the Explore tab to discover some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter. 
The video carousel is currently available to people in select countries using Twitter in English on iOS and Android.
Making Twitter the best place for video 
We want to make it easy for everyone to use our service in the way that best fits their needs, and videos (including fun movie teasers) an important part of that.
Keep your eyes on Twitter for more updates on how we’re working to improve your media experience."

Our approach to the 2022 elections in Brazil and partnership with AFP
By
Twitter Brasil
Wednesday, 28 September 2022
The Brazilian presidential elections are happening, and Twitter is working to encourage safe and informed civic participation.
To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more.
Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil.
Seeing what’s happening in the elections
Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. 
The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place.
We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account.
Focusing on civic integrity
Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts.
With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:
Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them
That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election
That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions
Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.
It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.
Keeping people informed
To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources.
We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more.
Curating reliable content
We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area.
Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period.
Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media.
Encouraging participation in the conversation
We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. 
To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used.
We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. 
Beyond the elections: Twitter’s partnership with AFP
Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. 
That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include:
Trends
The Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels

The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium is now open to researchers
By
Yoel Roth
Thursday, 22 September 2022
Twitter is committed to data-driven transparency. 
In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. 
These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.
Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.
How to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium
Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. 
We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. 
Why is transparency such a priority at Twitter?
Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. 
By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.
For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. 
Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. 
Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."

How recommendations help you discover more on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 20 September 2022
Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. 
If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.
Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).
If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them.
How and where Twitter recommends content
The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals.
Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. 
Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.
Maintaining a high standard for recommendations
Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic.
Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. 
Controlling your recommendations
In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. 
One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. 
You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content.
How we’re Improving recommendations
Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. 
This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t.
With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. 
We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."

Twitter Accessibility
Monday, 19 September 2022
Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. 
That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. 
Here’s how it works — and why it’s important.
Activating Twitter’s new image description reminder
Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter.
Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image.
We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:
Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder
Why is it important to add image descriptions? 
Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. 
Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: 
“An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.”
You can read more about how to write great image descriptions.
Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.
Improving accessibility at Twitter
Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets.
This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. 
In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.
You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."

Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Friday, 16 September 2022
Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter.
From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most.
And the summer of 2022 has been no different.
September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter.
Music
In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album.
K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views.
And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday?
Movies and TV
When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. 
Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther?
Current Events
The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling.
Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral.
Sports
The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. 
And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter.
In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan.
And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever.
We come together on Twitter
These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

How many people come to Twitter for news? As it turns out, a LOT
By
Twitter News
Monday, 12 September 2022
People come to Twitter for many reasons. As it turns out, one of the biggest is to stay informed about current events.
Whether it’s politics, world & local news, entertainment, sports, technology, or health & wellness, Twitter has become home to some of the most relevant conversations about news and current events happening around the world.
Why is this important information to know? First, it helps us understand and better serve people’s interests. Second, it reinforces the importance of the work we’re doing to address misinformation, add helpful context to Tweets, and keep people better informed about the news they consume on Twitter.
To help give you visibility into some of these findings, we’ve compiled learnings from studies Twitter has performed with YouGov and Sparkler, as well as internal Twitter data and third party research from groups like YouGov and Pew Research. Unless otherwise noted, these studies and surveys have been conducted with respondents in the US. 
Read on to learn more about the ways people engage with current events on Twitter.

Serena Williams has been a dominant force on the tennis court for 27 years — and while Twitter hasn’t been around quite that long, she continues to rack up the W’s here as well.
Last week, in addition to shattering ESPN’s all-time tennis viewership record during her farewell match at the US Open, Serena was officially crowned the most Tweeted about female athlete of all time.
It’s true. During the course of 2022's US Open alone, she’s been mentioned in over a million Tweets and counting. Here are some more stats you might be interested to know:
Serena has over 10.7 million Twitter followers and still ranks among the top 20 female athletes with the most new followers in 2021 — more than two decades after her career began
@serenawilliams is the most mentioned player handle in the tennis conversation globally since the start of the US Open
All of the top 5 most Retweeted Tweets about tennis since the start of US Open are about Serena
Serena continues to bring new audiences to tennis, with approximately 30% of users who Tweeted about Serena in August having not Tweeted about tennis all year 
We just wanted to give credit where credit’s due. Here’s to 367 major match victories, 23 Grand Slam singles championships, 4 gold medals and countless memories.

Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 7 September 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed.
As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter.
The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. 
Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.
A better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch
We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way.
New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.
Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability.
*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.
Expanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes
With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. 
We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. 
The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. 
Understanding the impact of Birdwatch
Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter.
According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. 
This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

By
Twitter Inc.
Thursday, 1 September 2022
The screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That’s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon (like the one at the bottom of this article).
It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks.
Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited.
What is Edit Tweet?
So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.
For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet.
For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.
Who will be testing Edit Tweet?
Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful.
Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter.
The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.
Participating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you
We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.
Turn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we’ll have more to share soon!"

Introducing Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 30 August 2022
Sometimes you just want to talk to your people. That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. 
With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers.
We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.
Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. 
Selecting your circle
Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. 
Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. 
You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. 
Personalizing your Twitter experience
We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction.
Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:
Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves
Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts
Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends
Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings
I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.
Twitter Creator
@itszaeok
I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!

@seangarrette
Some results from our Twitter Circle test include:
Increased overall Tweeting 
Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)
Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.
LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

Our approach to the 2022 elections in Brazil and partnership with AFP
By
Twitter Brasil
Wednesday, 28 September 2022
The Brazilian presidential elections are happening, and Twitter is working to encourage safe and informed civic participation.
To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more.
Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil.
Seeing what’s happening in the elections
Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. 
The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place.
We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account.
Focusing on civic integrity
Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts.
With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:
Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them
That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election
That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions
Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.
It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.
Keeping people informed
To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources.
We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more.
Curating reliable content
We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area.
Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period.
Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media.
Encouraging participation in the conversation
We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. 
To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used.
We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. 
Beyond the elections: Twitter’s partnership with AFP
Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. 
That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter.
AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include:
Trends
The Explore tab
Search
Prompts
Tweet labels

The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium is now open to researchers
By
Yoel Roth
Thursday, 22 September 2022
Twitter is committed to data-driven transparency. 
In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. 
These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.
Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.
How to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium
Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. 
We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. 
Why is transparency such a priority at Twitter?
Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. 
By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.
For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. 
Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. 
Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."

How recommendations help you discover more on Twitter
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 20 September 2022
Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. 
If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.
Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).
If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them.
How and where Twitter recommends content
The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals.
Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. 
Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.
Maintaining a high standard for recommendations
Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic.
Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. 
Controlling your recommendations
In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. 
One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. 
You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content.
How we’re Improving recommendations
Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. 
This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t.
With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. 
We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."

Twitter Accessibility
Monday, 19 September 2022
Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. 
That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. 
Here’s how it works — and why it’s important.
Activating Twitter’s new image description reminder
Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter.
Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image.
We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:
Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder
Why is it important to add image descriptions? 
Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. 
Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: 
“An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.”
You can read more about how to write great image descriptions.
Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.
Improving accessibility at Twitter
Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets.
This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. 
In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.
You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."

Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter
By

Friday, 16 September 2022
Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter.
From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most.
And the summer of 2022 has been no different.
September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter.
Music
In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album.
K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views.
And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday?
Movies and TV
When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. 
Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther?
Current Events
The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling.
Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral.
Sports
The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. 
And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter.
In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan.
And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever.
We come together on Twitter
These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

How many people come to Twitter for news? As it turns out, a LOT
By
Twitter News
Monday, 12 September 2022
People come to Twitter for many reasons. As it turns out, one of the biggest is to stay informed about current events.
Whether it’s politics, world & local news, entertainment, sports, technology, or health & wellness, Twitter has become home to some of the most relevant conversations about news and current events happening around the world.
Why is this important information to know? First, it helps us understand and better serve people’s interests. Second, it reinforces the importance of the work we’re doing to address misinformation, add helpful context to Tweets, and keep people better informed about the news they consume on Twitter.
To help give you visibility into some of these findings, we’ve compiled learnings from studies Twitter has performed with YouGov and Sparkler, as well as internal Twitter data and third party research from groups like YouGov and Pew Research. Unless otherwise noted, these studies and surveys have been conducted with respondents in the US. 
Read on to learn more about the ways people engage with current events on Twitter.
People engage regularly with news on Twitter

Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes,"Wednesday, 30 November 2022",https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/birdwatch-getting-new-onboarding-process-more-visible-notes,"Product
Birdwatch is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes
By
Twitter Inc.
Wednesday, 7 September 2022
As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes.
Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed.
As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter.
The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. 
Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.
A better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch
We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way.
New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.
Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability.
*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.
Expanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes
With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. 
We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. 
The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. 
Understanding the impact of Birdwatch
Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter.
According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.
Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: 
In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. 
This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

By

Thursday, 1 September 2022
The screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That’s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon (like the one at the bottom of this article).
It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks.
Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited.
What is Edit Tweet?
So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more.
For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet.
For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said.
Who will be testing Edit Tweet?
Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful.
Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter.
The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.
Participating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you
We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we’ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.
Turn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we’ll have more to share soon!"

Introducing Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd
By
Twitter Inc.
Tuesday, 30 August 2022
Sometimes you just want to talk to your people. That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. 
With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers.
We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.
Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. 
Selecting your circle
Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. 
Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. 
You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. 
Personalizing your Twitter experience
We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction.
Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:
Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves
Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts
Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends
Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings
I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.

@itszaeok
I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!
Twitter Creator
@seangarrette
Some results from our Twitter Circle test include:
Increased overall Tweeting 
Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)
Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.
LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

Accelerating our climate commitments on Earth Day

Friday, 22 April 2022
This month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new and alarming report, underscoring the urgency of the climate crisis – “immediate and deep emissions reductions,” they wrote, are necessary to turn the tide on global warming.
Now more than ever, meaningful climate action, from all of us, is critical. Today – on #EarthDay2022 – we’re sharing more about our work to serve the climate conversations happening across Twitter, plus the latest on our own sustainability commitments. 
Climate-forward approach to ads 
People around the world use Twitter to connect with others passionate about protecting our planet. Last year, we introduced a dedicated Topic to help people find personalized conversations about climate change. And, to support conversation around #COP26, we rolled out pre-bunks — hubs of credible, authoritative information across a range of key themes, like the science backing climate change, made available in the Explore tab, Search, and Trends. 
To better serve these conversations, misleading advertisements on Twitter that contradict the scientific consensus on climate change are prohibited, in line with our inappropriate content policy. We believe that climate denialism shouldn’t be monetized on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis. This approach is informed by authoritative sources, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports. 
We recognize that misleading information about climate change can undermine efforts to protect the planet. In the coming months, we’ll have more to share on our work to add reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations happening on Twitter. 
Sustainability at Twitter
We continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts, and we’re laser focused on reducing our own carbon footprint. Through targeted work, we’ve lowered our emissions for the second straight year – even as the company grew.
In 2019, we shared plans to achieve 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. With the help of our partners at Watershed, we’ll be utilizing zero-carbon electricity for all of our data centers, and for surrounding offices in the US and Canada. Our Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are sourced from solar and wind power projects in the same geographic region in which energy was used, and cover 100% of Scope 2 emissions from these sites. 
Earlier this year, we joined the EU climate pact, committing to ambitious North Star and Pathway pledges, in line with Paris Agreement goals. We’re committed to transitioning to renewable electricity in all our EU leased operations; using 100% carbon-neutral energy in our directly leased buildings by 2025; and upping our investments in carbon removal technologies. 
In 2021, we were proud to join the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and we’re actively pursuing those targets. By 2030, we’re set to have significantly reduced our greenhouse gas emissions, paving the way for our net-zero journey. 
Since 2020, we’ve measurably advanced our CDP score, achieving a B grade for our comprehensive reporting on Twitter’s sustainability efforts. We believe that transparency should be central to our approach to sustainability. We’ll continue to report on our progress, providing regular, public-facing updates against our declared targets.
Climate community
Tackling the climate crisis requires meaningful, sustained collaboration. Through #AdsForGood grants, on-service support, trainings, and more, we’re partnering with organizations committed to environmental conservation and sustainability. These include Earth Day Network, United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Development Programme, Greenpeace, Voice for the Planet, Let Me Breathe, WWF, 350.org, FridaysForFuture, We Don’t Have Time, Climate Reality Project, and others.
What people are saying
The climate conversation happening on Twitter is ever-expanding and uniquely global. Since 2021, conversation about sustainability has grown by more than 150%. We’ve seen a 60%+ increase in terms like “restoring” and “rebalancing.” Discussion around waste reduction has increased by over 100%, and decarbonization by more than 50%. We know that protecting the environment is something that people on Twitter care about, and we’re always thinking about other ways to serve these conversations. 
How to get involved
We all have a part we can play in tackling this urgent, global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to joining a Twitter Space with environmental experts, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved. 
We encourage you to Tweet along with the #EarthDay2022 conversation happening on Twitter and follow the Climate Change Topic for more."

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q1 2022: Our Global Approach
By
James Loduca (he/him)
Tuesday, 19 April 2022
Our sights remain on the horizon. Since we announced our five-year Tweepforce representation goals at the top of 2020, we have made great strides in Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA). We’ve accelerated in the United States and are purposefully investing more IDEA resources globally because this work isn’t bound to one region or country. Simply put, we can’t serve a global public conversation without a globally inclusive approach.
In our recent 2021 Annual Report, “Lift as we rise” we shared more diversity data, which included three new global populations (military veterans, Tweeps with disabilities and those who identify as LGBTQIA+) and for the first time retention rates among Global Women Tweeps, US Black Tweeps, and US Latinx Tweeps.
Three months later, I’m pleased to share that we’ve continued to make good progress–– although not as evenly as we would like. We are particularly conscious of the need to do even more to diversify our leadership, invest in Women talent globally, and close the gap for representation of US Latinx talent. View our latest numbers on our Careers site.
One thing is clear from these numbers: we are on track to achieve our 2025 vision for representation of talent from underrepresented US populations–– a full two years early.  As we approach that milestone, we are mindful that we’ll need a new vision for Tweepforce representation, and it must be globally inclusive. With that, here’s a deeper look at the global work that will inform our approach:
Expanding Global Self-ID
Our path always starts with cultivating a company that reflects the diversity of the amazing people who use our service every day. Until 2021, Tweeps had the opportunity to voluntarily self-report race and ethnicity (in the US) and gender (globally). We knew we needed to go further if we were to build out a globally inclusive approach, so we redesigned our Self-ID program. Here’s an overview:
What is Self-ID? Self-ID refers to the process by which employers invite employees to voluntarily share certain personal information with their employer to inform inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility efforts. At Twitter, we expanded Self-ID to include more categories for all Tweeps around the world. Categories on our new Self-ID questionnaire include disability, gender identity, military service, race, and sexual orientation. We also ask about caregiver status, education, language, religion, and socio-economic background. We’re taking these bold steps to propel our company and industry forward. Check out our Self-ID questionnaire below.

How did we approach expanding Self-ID? Our new Global Self-ID system was built from the ground up with input from a number of cross-functional stakeholders, including:
Global Business Resource Group (BRG) Leaders: Knowing we cannot accurately capture 100% of all identities that make up our Tweepforce, our first step was to align with our BRG communities. The cultural insights and competencies they brought to the work from the very outset ensured the questions we asked were relevant and as inclusive as can be. They also played a key role as champions and advocates to drive participation across Twitter.
Systems & Testing: Our People Systems team reviewed a number of survey tools and systems, assessing each for accessibility, capability and suitability to achieve optimum user experience and data analysis. We ultimately decided on a bespoke Workday/AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) platform that allowed for key functionality, including the ability to multi-select answers and next level drop down options based on what a Tweep selected.
Accessibility: Our Center Of Excellence for Accessibility and IT teams worked to ensure compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines “AA” standards so that Self-ID is free from barriers which could prevent access for assistive technology users. While this represents a significant step forward, we have more work to do to ensure we are accessible to all— at Twitter, and on Twitter.
Legal: Our Legal teams led efforts to adhere to local laws enabling us to invite 97% of all Tweeps to voluntarily share who they are. Acknowledging there are some markets where it is not advisable/legally permissible to ask for certain sensitive personal information, we provided an anonymous survey.
Privacy: Our Privacy team ensured we adhered to complex data privacy issues globally. In offices with a very small number of employees and where Self-ID disclosures would be potentially identifiable, raising data privacy concerns, we were unable to expand the Self-ID program. Additionally, we aligned with our Privacy team on data access, storage and deletion to ensure we build trust in the Self-ID program.
Communications: Our internal communications team partnered on a multi-channel socialization strategy that our HRBPs and BRGs evangelized for maximum Tweep awareness and participation, including: how-to videos, data privacy and consent messaging, extensive FAQs, dedicated intranet landing site, executive champions & messaging, and a campaign video.
Global Diversity Framework
As a global company, we’re mindful that the diversity of our Tweeps across regions is vast. Against this backdrop, it is not always easy to even define diversity categories at a global level. So, to complement what we learned about our Tweeps through our expanded Self-ID, we conducted research to learn about the global markets where Twitter has a presence and developed a Global Diversity Framework to help us define diversity and inform how we approach this work across regions. Two key findings inform our Global Diversity Framework:
There are a number of categories and underrepresented populations that all international regions have in common, including Gender, Ethnicity & Race, Disability, and LGBTQ+, which we are adapting as priority focus areas. 
There is also a range of country-specific underrepresented and historically-excluded communities related to language, religion, and socio-economic status in International regions.
So what’s ahead?
Self-ID and our Global Diversity Framework are just the beginning and have already provided us a lens to ensure our IDEA programming is regionally relevant–– especially for historically-excluded communities.
In short, these two programs are designed to consciously include. They will help us evaluate the equity of our policies, procedures, and programs like professional development, mentorship, and sponsorship, as well as promotions and performance management. Critically, the combination of Self-ID and the Global Diversity Framework helps us identify representation gaps in every part, level, and region of Twitter — along with the evidence base to set goals and targets for global inclusion into the future.
As we prepare to introduce a new globally-inclusive Tweepforce representation five-year vision at the end of this year, we’re not waiting around. This year, we will pilot targeted hiring programs in each of the international regions focusing on Women in engineering and tech in Ireland, India, Singapore and the UK, as well as Black talent in Brazil.
We know increasing representation is as much about talent retention as it is about talent acquisition so we will continue to focus on our inclusion programming and leadership development globally. Building on what we’ve detailed in our Cultivating Inclusion blog from July 2021, here’s some recent work we’ve done and what we’re looking forward to next:
Global BRG Leadership: We’ve made great progress in expanding our global BRG leadership in international regions. In 2019 we set a goal to have at least 25% of our BRG Global Leadership team outside the US. Today, 30% of our Global Chairs/leadership now hail from International regions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, UAE, and the UK.
#UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit: We’re expanding our IDEA-focused Learning & Development courses designed to cultivate inclusive Tweeps and leaders. The self-paced e-learnings will include Words Matter, Allyship 101, Working Across Cultures, Inclusive Leadership, Anti-Racism 101, Breaking Down Bias, and Accessibility 101. To further enhance international region-specific learning, we also provide tailored IDEA Training to allow for exploration and workshopping of live issues in a particular country or team.
Expanding Global Mentorship: Mentorship is crucial for professional development and career advancement, and yet we know that access to mentorship is historically inequitable. Mentoring@ was created to be intentionally inclusive and globally accessible. Initially piloted across our BRG communities and welcoming 1,000 participants in the first round, we’ve just launched the second round and will expand company-wide this year.
Sponsorship: We’re excited to introduce a Sponsorship program for mid-level talent in 2022. Building on Mentoring@, this program will pair executives as sponsors with talent from historically-excluded backgrounds and senior Women Tweeps, and will facilitate expedited career advancement opportunities.
Executive development: To complement our existing suite of development programs, we introduced a new executive development program for women at the highest levels to expand their influence. We also have a personalized leadership development initiative to increase and accelerate the impact of high performers and critical talent from under-represented populations.
#UntilWeAllBelong Summit: Following the sun, the 2021 summit kicked off in Singapore and featured live programming across JAPAC, EMEA, LATAM, and the US. We tackled timely regional topics and normalized important discussions about culture, diversity, accessibility, equity, and social justice. We also celebrated the progress and had frank conversations about the work that’s left to do. Planning for the 2022 summit is underway. In the meantime, we have kicked off a Twitter Together speaker series for Tweeps in International regions which will run throughout 2022.
We know we need to be both intentional and tenacious to ensure we are truly globally inclusive. With the company continuing to grow at pace, we are determined to ensure our IDEA work has the same positive impact wherever our Tweeps are in the world.

Our ongoing approach to the war in Ukraine
By
Sinéad McSweeney
Wednesday, 16 March 2022
Editorial note: This blog was first published on the 16th of March 2022, and last updated on the 7th of September 2022 to include updates to our metrics on the impact of our work.
More on our approach in English, Ukrainian, and Russian
Like so many around the world, we’re disturbed and deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding there. Our top priority is to promote the safety of people on and off the service, and our teams are working diligently to that end.
We believe we have a responsibility to the public – particularly during periods of crisis – to proactively enforce our rules, preserve access to Twitter, elevate credible and reliable information, protect the privacy and safety of the people who use our service and others, and guard against efforts to manipulate the public conversation.
Over the past several weeks, people in Ukraine, Russia, and around the world have used Twitter to share critical information in real-time, locate support, connect with one another, and raise their voices. Unfortunately, we are also aware that Twitter is being restricted for some people in Russia. As we’ve said previously, we believe that a free and open internet is vital, and that people around the world should have the same access to information. We take our collective role, and the role of our service, seriously. 
Below, we’re sharing updates to our approach and more detailed information about our efforts.
Elevating reliable information
Given the important role that algorithms play in recommending and amplifying content online, we believe that content moderation must extend beyond the leave-up-take-down binary. Our approach is two-fold:
If content is in violation of the Twitter Rules, we’ll take enforcement action against it at the Tweet or account level – this includes content removal.
When the risks for immediate harm associated with a Tweet are less severe, but where left uncontextualized may mislead people, we focus on reducing its reach and not proactively amplifying the Tweets into peoples’ timelines. De-amplifying content significantly reduces its visibility and labels add important context.
From Home Timeline to Explore, we’re making it easier to find reliable updates and information and enhance safety.
Our curated Twitter Moments about the war in Ukraine share real-time news and resources in multiple languages, and since the beginning of the conflict, the moments have had more than 38.6 billion impressions.**
Curators have contextualized ~3,000 related Trends in 17 countries and seven languages since the beginning of the crisis, helping Twitter users answer the question “Why is this trending?” by attaching representative Tweets, writing explanatory titles and descriptions, or associating these Trends to Moments to give users even more context.**
Our Search and Home Timeline prompts surface critical digital safety and security resources in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.
Our dedicated event pages are available in 12 languages and in more than 67 countries – we continue to expand this tool.
We created a Topic to help people stay informed right in the Home Timeline, as well as a Twitter List featuring reliable news sources.
For people using Twitter in Ukraine and Russia, we’ve paused some Tweet recommendations from people not followed on Home Timeline to reduce the risk of spreading unhealthy content. 
More broadly, we’re working across features like Topics, Lists, and Spaces to reinforce safety measures and guard against misuse – it’s important these tools are reliable and trustworthy.
Our approach to state-affiliated media 
Since 2020, we have not recommended or amplified state-affiliated media accounts from certain countries and have added labels, including to Russian-linked entities. Last month, we expanded our approach, adding labels to Tweets that share links to Russian state-affiliated media websites. Much of the content from state-affiliated media came from these link shares, and not just from the accounts we’d been labeling as state-affiliated media. 
Since February 28, we’ve labeled more than 910,175 unique Tweets that contain links to Russian state-affiliated media.** As noted above, and as is standard with our labels, these Tweets are not eligible for amplification, meaning they aren’t recommended in your home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. Our interventions continue to make a difference in decreasing the reach of this content. (a selection of early results from the effect of these interventions showed a 30% reduction of the reach of this content*).
We’ve now begun adding additional labels to multiple state-affiliated media accounts from Belarus. We have also labeled one state-affiliated media account in Ukraine. As the conflict – and online conversation – evolves, we want to equip people on Twitter with context and enable informed experiences on the service.  We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated with a state actor.
During periods of conflict, enabling access to factual, reliable information, and making clear which accounts are controlled by participating states, is critical.  To serve this mission, we’ll apply government and state-affiliated media labels to states engaged in inter-state conflict, in addition to those countries already covered by our existing work. The policy will help ensure we add context to conversations about global conflicts equitably. We intend to expand on our approach, labeling more countries over time. 
The recently announced European Union (EU) sanctions legally require us to withhold certain state-affiliated media content in EU member states, and we are complying with this requirement. Our global approach outside of the EU will continue to focus on de-amplifying this type of state-affiliated media content across our service and providing important context through our labels. 
Our approach to government labels
We are labeling qualifying government accounts to provide additional context. We’ll be rolling out government account labels to Ukrainian government accounts.
5 April 2022
A free and open internet is vital, and people around the world should have equal and shared access to information. When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public’s voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created. Particularly in moments of active, armed interstate conflict, the harms created by this imbalance are acute; access to information, and to the ability to share information, are of paramount importance. 
We seek to promote open access to information through public conversation. To address the harmful dynamics created by blocks and limitations on online services, we will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict – whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not. This means these accounts won’t be amplified or recommended to people on Twitter, including across the Home Timeline, Explore, Search, and other places on the service. We will first apply this policy to government accounts belonging to Russia.
Attempts by states to limit or block access to free information within their borders are uniquely harmful, and run counter to Twitter’s belief in healthy and open public conversation. We’re committed to treating conversations about global conflicts more equitably, and we’ll continue to evaluate whether this policy may be applied in other contexts, beyond interstate armed conflict. 
On broader rule enforcement
As we do around major global events, our safety and integrity teams are actively monitoring for potential risks. We recognize some high-profile accounts, including those of journalists (especially female journalists), activists, agencies, and government officials, may be particularly vulnerable. We’re working to mitigate any attempts at targeted account takeover or manipulation and have made account security resources available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. We are also working with our partners around the world, including members of our Trust and Safety Council, to identify and escalate urgent requests for support from journalists, activists, and others in need of assistance. 
We continue to proactively assess for inauthentic behavior and other violations of our rules. As of April 2022, we had removed more than 100,000 accounts* for violations of our platform manipulation and spam policy and this work continues today through proactive detection and human review. These accounts represent a wide range of attempts to manipulate the service – including opportunistic, financially-motivated spam — and we don’t currently believe they represent a specific, coordinated campaign associated with a government actor. 
We have also seen a substantial increase in the volume of media shared with deceptive, misleading, or inaccurate context, including old videos of conflicts, shared as if they’re taking place in Ukraine. In line with our synthetic and manipulated media policy, we have labeled or removed more than 66,407 pieces of content.**
Our teams are proactively monitoring for violations of our hateful conduct policy and rules prohibiting the promotion of violence, and will continue to enforce against accounts or Tweets targeting people on the basis of their nationality and other groups as new narratives emerge. In line with our abusive behavior policy, specifically regarding the denial of violent events, we have taken enforcement action on numerous accounts that denied or shared misleading claims about violent actions and those affected during the war. 
We value transparency in this work, and in the coming months we intend to release targeted datasets about the conflict to the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) for further analysis. 
5 April 2022
In the development and enforcement of our rules, we remain focused on enabling public conversation, and protecting the safety of people both online and offline. We are guided by international humanitarian law, specifically Article 13 of Geneva Convention III (on protecting prisoners of war (PoWs) from any physical or psychological abuse or threat thereof, and encompasses a prohibition on humiliating them) and do not want Twitter to be used by state actors to infringe this law. Our work to protect the conversation is informed by consultation with a wide range of trusted partners, including international human rights organizations, to ensure our approach considers the number of factors at play.
To that end, we will now ask government or state affiliated media accounts to remove any media published that features prisoners of war (PoW) under our private information and media policy.
We will also add a warning interstitial to media published by government or state affiliated media accounts featuring PoWs, that has a compelling public interest. 
Lastly, we will now require the removal of any Tweets, regardless of who posts them, if there is PoW content shared with abusive intent, such as insults, calls for retaliation, mocking/taking pleasure in suffering of PoWs, or for any other behavior that violates the Twitter rules. 
10 May 2022
In April, we announced that we would not amplify or recommend government accounts of states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict, beginning with Russian government accounts. Our approach has proven effective – for Russian government accounts, early results show that;
Engagements per Tweet decreased by approximately 25%;
The number of accounts that engaged with those Tweets decreased by 49%.
We’ve long believed that content moderation should extend beyond the removal of content or accounts. Not amplifying – meaning the content isn’t recommended on Home Timelines and other surfaces – and adding contextual labels quickly reduces content’s reach and visibility on Twitter, at scale. 
We consider a range of enforcement actions, and aim to ensure they're proportionate to the risk of harm created by the content. People's choices also influence how and what they see on Twitter; in this case, content from these accounts will still be shown to their followers, but won't be recommended to other people on Twitter.
Our approach to monetization
Since the week of February 21, we’ve paused advertising in Ukraine and Russia to ensure that critical public safety information is elevated, and that ads don’t detract from the conversation on Twitter.
Content that discusses or focuses on the war, or that is considered false or misleading under the Twitter Rules, is not eligible for monetization. We’ve also demonetized Search terms related to the war, preventing ads from appearing on the Search results pages for certain words.
Taking a step back, it’s important to keep in mind that since 2017 we’ve banned advertising from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik and donated the profits to NGOs working on digital literacy, misinformation, and election integrity. In 2019, we banned all state-backed news media advertising and political advertising.
Supporting impacted communities
We continue to engage and support humanitarian organizations on the ground. Through our giving campaign for Twitter employees, we’re routing donations to recognized organizations directly supporting Ukrainian refugees, matching all donations, and making direct contributions to partner organizations. 
We’re also providing high-value product donations and Ads for Good grants to help further these organizations’ critical work and amplify their message on Twitter. So far, these campaigns have made more than 118,271,185 impressions* on Twitter.
What’s next?
As the situation in Ukraine evolves, we’ll continue to iterate on our approach, focusing on reducing potential harm and surfacing reliable information. Follow @TwitterSupport, @TwitterSafety, and @Policy for real-time updates from our teams.

Наш поточний підхід до війни в Україні
Примітка редакції. Цей допис було вперше опубліковано 16 березня 2022 року. Його остання версія від 7 вересня 2022 року включає оновлені показники впливу нашої роботи.
Відомості про наш підхід доступні англійською, українською та російською мовами.
Ми, як і безліч інших людей з усього світу, занепокоєні й пригнічені через вторгнення Росії в Україну та гуманітарну катастрофу, яка там розгортається. Нашим найпершим пріоритетом є сприяння безпеці людей у нашому сервісі та за його межами, і наші команди активно працюють над цим.
Ми вважаємо, що несемо перед громадськістю відповідальність (особливо в періоди кризи) за проактивний контроль над дотриманням наших правил, збереження доступу до Twitter, підвищення видимості достовірної і надійної інформації, захист конфіденційності та безпеки користувачів нашого сервісу та інших людей, а також запобігання маніпулюванню громадським діалогом.
Протягом останніх кількох тижнів люди з України, Росії та всього світу користувалися Twitter, щоб ділитися критично важливою інформацією в режимі реального часу, знаходити підтримку, спілкуватися та висловлювати свої думки. Ми знаємо, що доступ до Twitter у Росії зараз обмежується для певних людей. Як ми вже казали, ми вважаємо, що вільний та відкритий Інтернет є критично важливим і що в людей у всьому світі повинні бути однакові можливості доступу до інформації. Ми відповідально ставимося до нашої ролі й до ролі нашого сервісу. 
Нижче ми публікуємо новини щодо нашого підходу й докладнішу інформацію про наші дії.
Підвищення видимості надійної інформації
Зважаючи на важливу роль алгоритмів у рекомендації та поширенні контенту онлайн, ми вважаємо, що модерація контенту повинна виходити за рамки бінарної логіки «залишити/вилучити». Наш підхід двоїстий:
Якщо контент порушує правила Twitter, ми вживаємо відповідних дисциплінарних заходів на рівні твіту або облікового запису. До таких заходів належить, зокрема, вилучення контенту.
Якщо ризик безпосередньої шкоди, пов’язаний із твітом, не дуже серйозний, але без контексту цей твіт може вводити в оману, ми приділяємо основну увагу зменшенню його охоплення та не просуваємо його у стрічках користувачів. Обмеження поширення контенту суттєво знижує його видимість, а позначки дають додають важливий контекст.
Ми спрощуємо пошук надійних новин і достовірних відомостей, а також підвищуємо рівень безпеки в усіх розділах Twitter — від головної сторінки до вкладки «Огляд».
Добірні моменти Twitter про війну в Україні поширюють новини й ресурси в реальному часі кількома мовами, і з початку конфлікту користувачі переглянули ці моменти понад 38,6 мільярдів разів.**
З початку кризи куратори додали контекст приблизно до 3000 пов’язаних із нею трендів у 17 країнах сімома мовами. Завдяки цьому користувачам Twitter легше зрозуміти причини популярності цих трендів, адже куратори додають репрезентативні твіти, пишуть пояснювальні заголовки й описи, а також пов’язують ці тренди з моментами, щоб надати користувачам ще більше контексту.**
Підказки на сторінці пошуку й у стрічці на головній сторінці вказують на важливі ресурси щодо цифрової безпеки англійською, українською та російською мовами.
Наші спеціальні сторінки подій доступні 12 мовами в більш ніж 67 країнах, і ми продовжуємо працювати над розширенням можливостей цього інструменту.
Ми створили тему, щоб люди могли отримувати важливу інформацію прямо на головній сторінці, а також додали список надійних джерел новин.
Для користувачів Twitter з України та Росії ми перестали рекомендувати в стрічці на головній сторінці певні твіти від людей, на яких вони не підписані, щоб зменшити ризик поширення шкідливого контенту. 
Ми продовжуємо працювати над такими функціями, як «Теми», «Списки» та «Аудіокімнати», щоб посилити заходи безпеки та захистити ці функції від зловживання. Для нас важливо, щоб ці інструменти були надійними й достойними довіри.
Наш підхід до контрольованих державою ЗМІ 
З 2020 року ми не рекомендуємо й не просуваємо облікові записи ЗМІ, що контролюються урядами певних країн, а також додаємо до них позначки (зокрема, до російських). Минулого місяця ми розширили свій підхід і почали додавати позначки до твітів із посиланнями на сайти російських проурядових ЗМІ. Значна частина контенту з цих ЗМІ надходила саме через такі посилання, причому не лише від профілів, позначених як контрольовані державою ЗМІ. 
З 28 лютого ми позначили понад 910 175 унікальних твітівз посиланнями на російські проурядові ЗМІ**. Як ми вже зазначали, згідно з нашою стандартною практикою позначені твіти не підлягають посиленому поширенню, тобто ми не рекомендуємо їх на головній сторінці, у сповіщеннях та в інших розділах Twitter. Наше втручання й далі сприяє зменшенню охоплення такого контенту (добірка ранніх результатів вжиття цих заходів показала, що охоплення зменшилося на 30%*).
Тепер ми почали додавати позначки до облікових записів проурядових ЗМІ з Білорусі. Ми також позначили один такий обліковий запис з України. У той чай як військовий конфлікт — і його обговорення в Інтернеті — розвиваються далі, ми хочемо надати користувачам Twitter доступ до контексту й повноцінної інформації. Ми вважаємо, що люди мають право знати, чи пов’язані певні ЗМІ з державними суб’єктами.
В періоди конфліктів надзвичайно важливо забезпечувати доступ до первірених фактів і надійної інформації, а також показувати, які облікові записи контролюються державами-учасницями. Тому на додачу до тих країн, для яких ми вже використовуємо такі позначки, ми позначатимемо урядові облікові записи та облікові записи контрольованих державою ЗМІ з країн, що беруть участь у міждержавних конфліктах. Це допоможе нам неупереджено додавати контекст до обговорення глобальних конфліктів. Ми маємо намір поступово розширювати коло країн, де буде запроваджено цей підхід. 
Нещодавні санкції Європейського Союзу (ЄС) юридично зобов’язують нас обмежувати доступ до певного контенту з проурядових ЗМІ в країнах, що входять до ЄС, і ми виконуємо цю вимогу. Згідно з нашим глобальним підходом, у країнах за межами ЄС ми й надалі стримуватимемо поширення такого контенту в нашому сервісі та надаватимемо важливий контекст за допомогою позначок. 
Наш підхід щодо позначення урядових облікових записів
Ми позначаємо урядові облікові записи, що відповідають визначеним критеріям, щоб забезпечити додатковий контекст. Скоро ми плануємо додати такі позначки до урядових профілів з України.
5 квітня 2022 р.
Вільний і відкритий Інтернет є надзвичайно важливим, і люди у всьому світі повинні мати рівний і спільний доступ до інформації. Коли уряд блокує або обмежує доступ до онлайн-сервісів у державі, підриваючи здатність суспільства висловлюватись і мати вільний доступ до інформації, але продовжує використовувати онлайн-сервіси для власної комунікації, утворюється глибокий інформаційний дисбаланс. Особливо значною є шкода, яку такий дисбаланс завдає в часи активних збройних міждержавних конфліктів. Доступ до інформації та можливість поширювати інформацію мають першочергову важливість. 
Ми прагнемо сприяти відкритому доступу до інформації через публічне обговорення. Щоб протидіяти шкідливій динаміці, що виникла через блокування та обмеження доступу до онлайн-сервісів, ми не просуватимемо й не рекомендуватимемо урядові профілі з країн, які обмежують доступ до вільної інформації та беруть участь у міждержавних збройних конфліктах, незалежно від того, чи заблоковано в цих країнах Twitter. Це означає, що такі облікові записи не просуватимуться й не рекомендуватимуться користувачам Twitter у стрічці на головній сторінці, на вкладках «Огляд» і «Пошук» та в інших розділах платформи. Перш за все ми застосуємо цю політику до урядових облікових записів із Росії.
Спроби держав обмежити або заблокувати доступ до вільної інформації у межах своїх кордонів завдають великої шкоди й суперечать переконанням Twitter щодо здорового й відкритого публічного діалогу. Ми прагнемо забезпечити для всіх рівні можливості обговорення глобальних конфліктів і продовжимо оцінювати доцільність застосування цієї політики в інших контекстах, не пов’язаних із міждержавними збройними конфліктами. 
Додаткові заходи для забезпечення дотримання правил
Як і в разі будь-яких інших важливих глобальних подій, наші спеціалісти, що відповідають за безпеку й достовірності інформації, активно відстежують потенційні ризики. Ми розуміємо, що облікові записи певних відомих осіб, зокрема журналістів (особливо жіночої статі), активістів, організацій і урядових службовців, можуть бути особливо вразливими. Ми намагаємося запобігати будь-яким спробам цілеспрямованого захоплення облікових записів або маніпулювання ними й надаємо доступ до ресурсів щодо безпеки облікових записів англійською, українською та російською мовами. Крім цього, разом із нашими партнерами з усього світу, зокрема з членами Ради з безпеки та довіри, ми виявляємо термінові запити на підтримку від журналістів, активістів та інших людей, яким потрібна допомога, і передаємо їх відповідним особам. 
Ми продовжуємо проактивно відстежувати неавтентичну поведінку та інші порушення наших правил. Станом на квітень 2022 року ми видалили понад 100 000 облікових записів* через порушення нашої політики щодо щодо маніпулювання платформою та поширення спаму. Ця робота продовжується й зараз завдяки людям, які активно виявляють і розглядають порушення. Власники видалених облікових записів здійснили чимало спроб маніпулювання нашим сервісом, зокрема розсилали опортуністичний, фінансово вмотивований спам. Наразі немає підстав вважати, що вони є частиною скоординованої кампанії, пов’язаної з урядовим суб’єктом. 
Ми також помітили суттєве збільшення кількості медіафайлів, які поширюються в оманливому або неточному контексті, зокрема старих відео про інші конфлікти, що подаються під виглядом подій в Україні. У рамках нашої політики щодо штучно створених і спеціально оброблених медіафайлів ми позначили або видалили понад 66 407 одиниць контенту.**
Наші спеціалісти проактивно відстежують порушення політики щодо розпалювання ненависті та правил, я"
