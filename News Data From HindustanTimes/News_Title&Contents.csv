'The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill, 2020' was introduced in the Upper House amid protests from opposition parties.
BJP MP Kirodi Lal Meena moved for leave to introduce the Bill to provide for the constitution of the national inspection and investigation committee for preparation of a Uniform Civil Code and its implementation throughout India and for matters connected therewith during the private member's business.
However, Opposition members from the Congress, CPI, CPI(M), Trinamool Congress protested against the introduction of the Bill saying it will ""destroy"" the social fabric and unity in diversity that is prevalent in the country.
With the Opposition members seeking withdrawal of the Bill, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar called for division and the motion for introduction of the Bill was passed with 63 votes in favour and 23 against it.
In the past, although the Bill was listed for introduction, it was not moved in the Upper House.
The Bill envisages a collection of laws to protect the personal rights of all citizens without considering religion.

Global Hunger Index rank does not reflect India’s true picture: Smriti Irani,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-hunger-index-rank-does-not-reflect-india-s-true-picture-smriti-irani-101670581981106.html,"Minister of women and child development Smriti Irani dismissed India’s ranking in the Global Hunger Index (GHI), terming it as a “flawed measure of hunger,” in a reply to Lok Sabha on Friday.
“Global Hunger Index (GHI) does not reflect India’s true picture as it is a flawed measure of ‘Hunger’. It should not be taken at face value as it is neither appropriate nor representative of hunger prevalent in a country,” Irani said in reply to Congress MP Karti Chidambaram.
Dismissing the four indicators of GHI, Irani said, “Out of its four indicators, only one indicator, i.e., undernourishment, is directly related to hunger. The two indicators, namely, Stunting and Wasting, are outcomes of complex interactions of various other factors like sanitation, genetics, environment, and utilisation of food intake apart from hunger which is taken as the causative/outcome factor for stunting and wasting in the GHI.”

According to the 2022 Global Hunger Index, India ranks 107th out of 121 countries.
The GHI has assigned India a score of 29.1 and considers the level of hunger in India “serious” on a scale where a score of 50 is considered “extremely serious” hunger.
Replying to Congress MP Chidambaram’s inquiry on whether India’s increasing GHI score from 28.2 in 2014 to 29.1 in 2022 shows a worsening of the hunger crisis, Irani said, “India stood at rank 55 out of 76 countries, with a score of 28.2 in 2014. Indian rank was 80 out of 104 countries in 2015, 97 out of 118 countries in 2016, 100 out of 119 countries in 2017, 103 out of 119 countries in 2018, 102 out of 117 countries in 2019, 94 out of 107 countries in 2020 and 101 out of 116 countries in 2021.”
Notably, the GHI clarified that the higher 2022 GHI score for India as compared to the 2014 GHI score means that the GHI score for India has shown a “slight worsening”.
However, the GHI has also advised against comparing the scores of subsequent years by noting, “The current and historical data on which the GHI scores are based, is continually being revised and improved by the United Nations agencies that compile them, and each year’s GHI report reflects these changes.
Comparing scores between reports may create the impression that hunger has changed positively or negatively from year to year, whereas in some cases, the change may partly or fully reflect a data revision.
Replying to another question regarding the starvation-related deaths among children and adults in India since 2014, Irani denied that there were any incidents of starvation deaths from states or union territories.
In January this year, the Supreme Court pulled up the government while demanding the latest information on starvation deaths even as the Centre couldn’t provide an answer citing that there were no starvation-related deaths.
Irani, however, did highlight the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) implemented in all the states and union territories on an all-India basis with maximum coverage of 81.35 crore people, which is meant to address the hunger alleviation of the bottom 67% of the population at 2011 census.
She noted that the coverage under the Act is “substantially high” for ensuring vulnerable and needy sections can benefit from it.
“At present, against the intended coverage of 81.35 crore persons, the states/UTs have already identified 80.03 crore persons,” Irani’s reply read.
According to GHI’s website, the Global Hunger Index is a peer-reviewed annual report jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
It aims to comprehensively track and measure hunger at the global, regional, and country levels.
The GHI measures countries’ performance on four component indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Top US counter-terror official to visit India to review regional security,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-us-counter-terror-official-to-visit-india-to-review-regional-security-101670577242358.html,"The security situation in the region, including counter-terrorism efforts in the context of Afghanistan and Pakistan, is expected to figure in an upcoming meeting between the US acting coordinator for counterterrorism Timothy Betts and his Indian interlocutors.
Betts will lead the American delegation at the annual meeting of the India-US counter-terrorism joint working group in New Delhi from December 12-13, the US state department said on Friday. India will be the last leg of a three-nation tour by Betts, which includes Japan and the Philippines.
The joint working group will “review regional and global terrorist threat assessments, collaborative bilateral and regional counterterrorism programming, and initiatives to strengthen law enforcement and judicial partnerships”, the state department said.
People familiar with the matter said the situation in Afghanistan, especially the activities of several anti-India terror groups, such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), and the continued presence of these groups in Pakistan, are expected to figure in the upcoming meeting.

In Japan, Betts participated in trilateral counterterrorism discussions on December 8 with senior officials from Australia and Japan. These discussions focused on the “current terrorism landscape, including persistent threats in the Indo-Pacific”.
In the Philippines, he met senior officials from the department of foreign affairs and the Anti-Terrorism Council on Friday to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and the US-Philippines security partnership.
Betts’ visit comes a little more than a month after India hosted a special meeting of the UN Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in New Delhi in October. The ‘Delhi Declaration’ issued after that meeting described terrorism in all forms and manifestations as one of the most serious threats to global peace and security.
The CTC urged all UN member states to ensure “zero tolerance towards terrorism”, to deny terrorists access to safe havens, and to bring to justice those supporting or planning terror attacks. The meeting also focused on countering the use of new and emerging technologies by terrorists.
Global counter-terrorism will also be a key issue during India’s presidency of the UN Security Council in December as it winds up a two-year stint in the key body.

Earlier, Congress MP Tewari gave an adjournment motion notice in Lok Sabha to discuss matters related to statements made by different government functionaries over judicial appointment issue.
""Discussion on confrontation with the judiciary after statement by various government functionaries, including honourable law minister,"" Tewari said in his notice.
Pointing out that there are several vacancies in high courts and the Supreme Court, he said that these statements undermine faith in the judiciary.

On Thursday, the apex court said on the judicial appointment issue that the Collegium system was the ""law of the land"" and it should be followed. ""Making comments on the Supreme Court Collegium is not very well taken,"" SC told the Centre.

"‘Nitish Kumar's defeat, not of alliance’: Ex RJD MLA on Kurhani bypoll result",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-s-defeat-not-of-alliance-ex-rjd-mla-on-kurhani-bypoll-result-101670568282931.html,"Former Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) legislator Anil Sahani whose disqualification necessitated bypoll in Bihar's Kurhani Assembly constituency said that the defeat wasn't of the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) but of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Blaming the bypoll defeat on JD(U)'s choice of candidate, Sahani said that fielding a non-EBC candidate in an Extremely backward Class seat was a mistake.
The former MLA further stated that Mahagathbandhan candidate got the vote because of Bihar deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.
“It isn't the defeat of Mahagathbandhan, it's defeat of CM Nitish Kumar as non-EBC candidate was chosen for EBC (Extremely backward Class) seat. The vote we got was due to Dy-CM Tejashwi Yadav,” Anil Sahani said.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Kurhani Assembly seat defeating the Janata Dal (United) by 3,645 votes. BJP's Kedar Prasad Gupta won the bypoll by securing 76,722 votes, while JD (U)'s Manoj Kushwaha Singh got 73,073 votes.
Sahni, who has been convicted and sentenced to three years in jail in a case of fraud probed by CBI, demanded Nitish Kumar's resignation.
“The way Tejashwi Yadav sacrificed the party symbol (for bypoll), Nitish Kumar should also resign from the CM post and make Tejashwi Yadav the chief minister for strengthening 'Mahagathbandhan',” the former MLA added.
Former deputy chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi also demanded Nitish Kumar's resignation over the bypoll defeat.
""After the defeat in Gopalganj and now in Kurhani Assembly Bypoll Nitish Kumar should resign. In the 2014 Lok Sabha Election, Nitish Kumar was reduced to two seats in Bihar and then had to resign, similarly, he should accept that his popularity has decreased,"" Sushil Modi told ANI on Thursday.
""Nitish Kumar's core voters are mostly from backward caste and most of them have chosen BJP, though crores of rupees were distributed the day before polling night and yet JDU lost the election,"" he added.

Remembering India’s first CDS Gen Bipin Rawat,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remembering-india-s-first-cds-gen-bipin-rawat-101670570882154.html,"Raisina Hill legend has it that on the day the Chinese PLA with construction vehicles and road building equipment started moving towards Torsha nullah on Doklam Plateau on India-Bhutan-China trijunction in June 2017, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, then foreign secretary and now foreign minister S Jaishankar and then Army Chief and later Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat met Prime Minister Narendra Modi for military-diplomatic directions that afternoon. The trio informed the PM that the PLA objective was to reach Jampheri Ridge, unilaterally redefine the border at the tri-junction and put pressure on India’s ‘Chicken Neck’ or Siliguri Corridor. It is said that the PM asked them what should be done? The trio replied that the Chinese should be stopped. PM Modi apparently replied, “What are we waiting for?” That very day while Jaishankar diplomatically conveyed India’s serious concerns to both Beijing and Thimpu, the two Garhwali brothers pushed the Indian Army up to Jhampheri ridge and blocked the PLA from crossing the Torsha nullah bisecting the plateau.
Cut to August 2020. The PLA had transgressed into Kugrang Nullah, Gogra-Hot Springs and north banks of Pangong Tso earlier in May taking advantage of the fast-spreading Covid pandemic, which had origins in Wuhan in China. On June 15, 2020, the Indian Army lost 20 men including Col Santosh Babu in a medieval skirmish with PLA in Galwan Valley but not before teaching the Chinese Army a deadly lesson for making unilateral changes on the border and imposing the India rejected 1959 on the East Ladakh LAC. With Chinese refusing to restore April 2020 status quo ante on the Ladakh LAC, the Garhwali brothers with General Rawat now the CDS in synergy with then Army and Intelligence Chiefs and full back up support of now External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar launched an offensive on August 29-31, 2020 to capture heights south of Pangong Tso , Rezang La and Rechin La, effectively turning the tables on the belligerent PLA. It was none other than General Rawat who approved the deployment of India’s Special Frontier Force (SFF), a highly specialized mountain warfare division composed of exiled Tibetans and under the Cabinet Secretariat. The NSA was fully in charge of the operation and instructions were given to the Indian troops to militarily retaliate if the PLA moved up the Rezang La ridge or South Pangong Tso heights. Fact is that a round of high explosive extended range tank round was fired by the Indian armor to deter the PLA light tanks. Rest, as they say, is history and the PLA hate India for the SFF lesson.
One year after Gen Rawat and his wife Madhulika lost their lives in an helicopter crash in the Nilgiris and with his regiment mate Gen Anil Chauhan being appointed as the second CDS, the first CDS is remembered as a genuine military reformer who desperately tried to decolonize the Indian armed forces particularly the Indian Army. Not the one given to pomp, show or red carpet, Gen Rawat was disliked by his peers and some of the serving officers for contesting on extraordinary military canteen benefits, disability allowance, sub-standard military construction and even playing a round of golf in some 195 golf courses with the Indian Army all over the country. He told the armed forces that if they wanted to make money then they would get the same respect and credibility as a large section of Indian police. As Army Chief, he got the golf course at 15 Corps headquarters in Badami Bagh cantonment in Srinagar dug out as officers were seen to be disrespecting the fallen troops whose bodies landed at the adjacent helicopter-pad. An avid golfer, he stopped playing the game as an example to other officers.
While he led his troops by example, the first CDS was also brave enough to speak his mind to the political leadership and this attitude often got him into trouble with powers that be. But that did not make him change either his mind or his attitude. He was a war general not an arm-chair strategist.
Although General Rawat stood up to the enemy from Sumdorong Chu to Uri to Doklam to East Ladakh and came out victorious, he was let down by his own when he tried to push for military theatre commands as was his mandate as the first CDS. While he answered every query and objections raised by the three armed forces chiefs particularly the Indian Air Force chief, Gen Rawat could not complete the task during his life-time as none of the three chiefs wanted to lose their fiefdoms and financial powers. It is for Gen Chauhan to complete his late friend’s final task.

'Police should investigate his parents…': Shraddha Walkar's father on Aaftab,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shraddha-walkar-s-father-meets-fadnavis-investigation-against-aaftab-s-underway-101670569246233.html,"Shraddha Walkar's father Vikas Walkar on Friday met Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at his residence in Mumbai in connection with the Shraddha murder case. Addressing the media, he said Fadnavis assured him that he will get justice. BJP's Kirit Somaiya was also present as Shraddha Walkar's father went to meet Fadnavis. Aaftab Poonawala, Shraddha's live-in partner, who strangled Shraddha and then butchered her body into 35 parts will remain in judicial custody for another 14 days as a Saket court on Friday extended his custody. Aaftab was produced before the court through video conferencing.
""I have already met the Delhi governor and South Delhi DCP. They assured me that we will get justice. Now I met Devendra Fadnavis. He also assured me the same,"" Vikas Walkar said.

Talking about Aaftab who killed Shraddha, Vikas Walkar said, “Aaftab Poonawala should be given the maximum punishment. The police should also investigate his parents, he said. “Though the investigation is now progressing, there was some delay in the beginning,” Vikas Walkar said.
'Spoke to Shraddha last in 2021'
Replying to the questions of the journalists, Vikas Walkar said he did try to reach out to Shraddha after she left home but did not get much response. He said his last call with Shraddha was in 2021 when Shraddha told him that she was fine and she was in Bengaluru. ""She just asked me about my well-being and how is her brother,"" Vikas Walkar said.

'Spoke to Aaftab in September'
Vikas Walkar said he spoke to Aaftab in September this year after he started looking for Shraddha. ""I told him that Shraddha was with you for 2.5 to 3 years and if she leaves you and goes somewhere, isn;t it your responsibility to inform me? He said he did not know where Shraddha had gone,"" Vikas Walkar said.
'I didn't know about Shraddha's complaint against Aaftab in 2020'
Demanding probe against Aaftab's parents, Vikas Walkar said they were aware of everything while he had no clue that Aaftab used to threaten Shraddha. But what happened that Shraddha could not think of returning home? ""I also want to know that,"" Shraddha's father said.
The grisly murder of Shraddha Walkar came to light after her father filed a missing complaint in Maharashtra months after Shraddha was allegedly murdered in Delhi. Because of his objection to Shraddha's relationship with Aaftab, Vikas Walkar was not in touch with Shraddha and was not aware that she moved to Delhi with Aaftab. Vikas Walkar approached the police after Shraddha's friend alerted him that Shraddha's phone was not reachable for months.
As the case shifted from Maharashtra to Delhi, horrific details of how Aaftab killed her in May and then disposed of her body parts in the following months emerged.
It also came to light in the course of the investigation that Shraddha had complained against Aaftab two years ago. In her complaint, she explicitly mentioned that her life was under threat from Aaftab. Fadnavis promised a thorough investigation into the matter as to why no police action was taken even after the formal complaint in 2020. Police, however, said Shraddha later withdrew her complaint.

According to reports, Justice Lokur, who retired on December 30, 2018, and reportedly took part in the collegium meeting that approved the names of the two high court chief justices, said he was “disappointed” that the decision taken by the collegium on December 12, 2018, was not “followed and put out.”
While hearing the petition on December 2, the bench called itself the “most transparent institution”, adding the collegium system should not be derailed on the basis of statements of “some busybody.”
It further disapproved of adverse comments made by its former judges against the selection mechanism of the collegium, terming it a “fashion”.
Refusing to pay heed to the petitioner’s emphasis on justice Lokur’s statements, it said on that day, “We don’t want to comment on anything said by former members. Nowadays, it has become a fashion for the former members to comment upon the decision when they were part of the collegium.”
Bhardwaj had approached the Supreme Court against the denial of information to her by the top court’s administration regarding the agenda and other pertinent information about the December 2018 collegium meeting. Her appeals before the central information commission (CIC) and the Delhi high court also failed to elicit any positive response.
The Delhi high court, meanwhile affirming the decision of the public information officer of the SC administration earlier this year, held that in the absence of any formal resolution being adopted and signed by the members of the SC collegium for the said meeting, the authorities rightly took the position that there was no material liable to be disclosed. Further, it said that “unsubstantiated and unverified” press reports cannot be taken cognisance of.
Lately, the union government and the Supreme Court seems to be at loggerheads over the collegium system of appointing judges.
While various functionaries such as Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar and union law minister Kiren Rijiju have adversely commented on the system of selecting judges for constitutional courts, a Supreme Court bench has repeatedly pulled up the government over delays in clearing appointments, clarifying the collegium system is the law of the land which the executive is bound to follow.

'No wonder SC thinks…': TMC MP targets Election Commission over leader's arrest,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-wonder-sc-thinks-tmc-mp-targets-election-commission-over-leader-s-arrest-101670556277274.html,"Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien targeted the Election Commission over the arrest of the party's national spokesperson Saket Gokhale by Gujarat Police in a fresh case hours after he secured bail in a case related to his tweet about the Morbi bridge collapse tragedy. Gokhale was granted bail after he was produced before the court in Ahmedabad on Thursday following the completion of his police custody but was soon arrested in another case registered by Morbi police.
Saket Gokhale had tweeted a news clipping about information purportedly obtained through the Right to Information (RTI) claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Morbi after the bridge collapse cost ₹30 crore.
""RTI reveals that Modi’s visit to Morbi for a few hours cost ₹30 cr. Of this, ₹5.5 cr was purely for “welcome, event management, & photography”, Gokhale tweeted.
On Tuesday, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a 'fact check' saying the information was fake. An FIR was registered against Gokhale on the charges of forgery and printing defamatory content and he was arrested on December 6.
“BJP CM and an actor turned BJP MP spread communal bile during Gujarat election. What does EC do ? Look away,” O'Brien said in a tweet in an apparent reference to statements made by Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and former Lok Sabha member Paresh Rawal.
“@SaketGokhale of @AITCofficial gets bail in one case filed by Gujarat Police & was on his way to airport. What does EC do? Arrest him,” the Rajya Sabha member further wrote. “No wonder [Supreme Court] thinks EC is stooge”

What Supreme Court said
The Supreme Court last month lamented that successive governments have “completely destroyed” the independence of the ECI by ensuring no chief election commissioner (CEC) gets the full six-year term to head the poll body since 1996. A Constitution bench remarked that the absence of a law for appointment of election commissioners (ECs) has resulted in an “alarming trend”.
“It’s a very, very disturbing trend. After TN Seshan (who was CEC for six years between 1990 and 1996), the slide began when no person has been given a full term. What the government has been doing is that because it knows the date of birth, it ensures that anyone who is appointed as the CEC does not get his full six years... Be it the UPA (Congress-led United Progressive Alliance) government or this government, this has been a trend,” said the bench led by justice KM Joseph.
It added: “In this way, the so-called independence, which is just a lip service, is completely destroyed... Particularly in view of the disturbing trend that we have found... nobody can question them since there is no check. This is how the silences of the Constitution can be exploited. There is no law, no check. Everyone has used it to their interest... Pick up someone and give him a highly truncated tenure. He is obligated; does your bidding... we are not saying so but it looks like that.”

"Who is IPS Amit Lodha, facing graft case for Netflix's Khakee? 10 things to know",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-ips-amit-lodha-facing-graft-case-for-netflix-s-khakee-10-things-to-know-101670558726684.html,"Bihar's IGP (Inspector General of Police) Amit Lodha has hit the headlines for two reasons; first, the much-discussed Netflix series Khakee: The Bihar Chapter drew inspiration from his life and book Bihar Diaries and second, he has been booked by the Special Vigilance Unit of Bihar for allegedly taking money for Khakee. The vigilance unit said as he is still a serving IPS officer and not an established author, he can't sign a deal with a firm for the web series. Amit Lodha has been accused of receiving ₹12,372 from the deal while ₹38.25 lakh was credited to his wife Koumidi's account. The FIR said there was an agreement between the firm and Koumidi to facilitate the ""transaction of illicitly acquired wealth"".
""Sometimes life can throw you the most difficult challenges, particularly when you are right. It's during these times your strength of character is reflected. Need your prayers and support to come out victorious,"" Amit Lodha tweeted after the accusation.
10 things to know about Amit Lodha
1. Born in Jaipur, Amit Lodha studied at IIT Delhi and cracked the entrance on the first attempt.
2. However, his IIT experience was not pleasant as he recounted in an interview. He said he started suffering from an inferiority complex at IIT as he found it difficult to fit in.
3. The uneasiness of the IIT life pushed him towards UPSC and became an IPS officer in 1988.
4. Amit Lodha soon became a celebrated IPS because of his connection with the people.
5. Before being posted to Bihar, he was in Rajasthan. He became instantly popular as he used to tell people to call him directly at his landline number.
6. The case of the 'Gabbar Singh of Sheikhpura' brought Amit Lodha to the national headlines. Amit Lodha tracked the dreaded Mahto gang (Pintu Mahto, Ashok Mahto) who had several cases against them including jailbreak after killing two policemen, the murder of 15 people etc.
7. Amit Lodha was awarded the prestigious President's Police Medal for Meritorious Service, the Police Medal for Gallantry and the Internal Security Medal for several of his operations in his police career.
8. At present, the 48-year-old IPS officer is the IGP (Inspector General of Police)of Bihar.
9. Amit Lodha's book Bihar Diaries (2018) captured his chase of the gang though he did not name Mahto in his book. This book is the inspiration for the Netflix series, Khakee The Bihar Chapter.
10. Lodha's second book is Life in the Uniform published in 2021 where he recounted his journey to UPSC.

"Severe cyclone ‘Mandous’ heads for TN coast, may weaken marginally before landfall",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/severe-cyclone-mandous-heads-for-tn-coast-may-weaken-marginally-before-landfall-101670559205664.html,"Severe cyclone ‘Mandous’ is heading towards the Tamil Nadu coast as the latest readings on Friday morning indicate the weather pattern laying over southwest Bay of Bengal, moving nearly west-northwestwards about 240 km north-northeast of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), 240 km east-northeast of Jaffna (Sri Lanka), 240 km east-southeast of Karaikal and about 320 km south-southeast of Chennai.
It is likely to maintain intensity and clock wind speeds of 85-95 kmph, gusting to 105 kmph, for the next few hours and weaken thereafter into a cyclone.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), it will continue to move west-northwestwards and cross north Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts between Puducherry and Sriharikota around Mahabalipuram as a cyclone with a maximum sustained wind speed of 65-75 kmph, gusting to 85 kmph, till early hours of Friday.
Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and south Andhra Pradesh have been put on high alert and asked to brace for heavy rain.
Also Read:Cyclone Mandous: Red alert in 13 Tamil Nadu districts, heavy rain predicted
The storm surge of about 0.6 mts in height above the astronomical tide is likely to inundate low lying areas of north coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry at the time of landfall.
“Most atmospheric and oceanic conditions are favourable for cyclogenesis, including sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and energy, so it will gain intensity for tonight. But on Friday, as it moves closer to the land, Mandous will weaken into a cyclone again. We are also expecting dry winds from land to help weaken it,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.

Gujarat showcases the ‘51 per cent’ politics of BJP,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-showcases-the-51-per-cent-politics-of-bjp-101670558268342.html,"After being appointed BJP president for the second time on January 24, 2016, Amit Shah told Hindustan Times that his party will have to devise a strategy of “51 per cent politics” to defeat electoral forces. The now Union home minister said six years ago that the central point of politics had shifted from Congress to BJP, and it will be “BJP versus all” or “Narendra Modi versus all” in future akin to “Congress versus all” or “Indira Gandhi versus all” of the past as adversaries will join hands for political survival.
The Gujarat Assembly election result where BJP managed a mammoth first time 52.5 percent vote share even after ruling the state for six consecutive terms is the ambitious mandate that BJP leadership led by charismatic Prime Minister Narendra Modi and workaholic Amit Shah were working for. The electoral result shows how astute politics and hard work by the highly efficient party machinery can be synergized to deliver beyond the “51 per cent” mandate.
While the Congress has won Himachal Pradesh Assembly election and the AAP has won the MCD local elections in Delhi, the BJP vote share in the hill state is just 0.9 per cent below the winning party and the party has added one more per cent vote in the Delhi municipal elections and gave a tough fight to the winner despite carrying anti-incumbency of past 15 years.
The election results clearly indicate that the BJP leadership has not allowed the party to be jaded in Gujarat by infusing fresh political blood, new jobs and state pride linked initiatives while keeping the law and order situation under control. The belief that PM Modi can do nothing wrong for Gujarat backed by well-oiled party machinery has given yet another ruling mandate to the party with an overwhelming vote share.
While the BJP leadership knew that it was facing an uphill task in Himachal Pradesh after the party lost the Mandi Lok Sabha seat and three Assembly seats last November, the party did not let go of the fight till the end in a state that is known to change its rulers after every five years. The central leadership sent national vice president Saudan Singh to Shimla as early as April-May to sharpen the electoral campaigning in the hill state. Despite facing traditional anti-incumbency, the results show that the party did very well in the Mandi segment and just lost by 0.9 per cent vote. The fact is that if the AAP party had put the same effort in Himachal as it had put in Gujarat, it would have cut into anti-BJP votes and the results would have been different.
The electoral wins in Rampur Assembly bye-elections, a bastion of Samajwadi Party’s Azam Khan, and in Kurhani Assembly seat bye-elections in Bihar, where all parties ganged up against the BJP, show that the right-wing conservative party is relentlessly working 24 X 7 and 365 days a year. The fact is that while Amit Shah stayed in Gujarat to lead the party on the ground in the run-up to Gujarat, PM Modi was following a back-breaking schedule by taking a series of meetings in the PMO in Delhi and then addressing rallies all over the state.
Although municipal elections are no match for Assembly or Parliament elections, the BJP pushed all its big guns on ground from party President J P Nadda and senior Cabinet ministers to ensure that the party’s vote share went up by one per cent and stood up to the ruling AAP party with its freebies for its voters.
After winning Gujarat hands down, PM Modi addressed jubilant party workers on Thursday evening where he cautioned against political adversaries and their force multipliers. He also gave the vision of “Developed India” by 2047 to party supporters. This future challenge caters to the aspirational India and throws the political gauntlet at BJP’s adversaries to come up with a better objective for the youth who will vote in 2024.

Limited herbicide usage to seed production in case of GM mustard: Centre to RS,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/limited-herbicide-usage-to-seed-production-in-case-of-gm-mustard-centre-to-rs-101670556720141.html,"Use of herbicide glufosinate ammonium in genetically modified mustard DMH 11 will be limited to seed production stage by the seed producing company and not during commercial cultivation, union environment ministry informed Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
Minister of state for MoEFCC (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India), Ashwini Kumar Choubey said this in response to a question by Aneel Prasad Hegde, MP from Bihar.
Hegde had asked two questions, first, whether the bar gene in parental lines and hybrid offspring of Delhi University’s GM mustard confers herbicide tolerance to genetically modified mustard plants and whether India has put into place regulatory protocols to specifically test for the safety of HT GM crops as opposed to any other GM crop 3.
Also Read:Bihar: Ex-agri minister urges CM Nitish Kumar to ban GM mustard; threatens stir
“The bar gene in Mustard hybrid DMH-11 is expressed which encodes phosphinothricin N-acetyl transferase enzyme that confers resistant to herbicide glufosinate ammonium. Genetically Modified (GM) Hybrid Mustard DMH11 has not been approved for Herbicide Tolerant (HT) trait but for a GM technology for hybrid seed production,” Choubey said in reply.
“The HT characteristic/trait present in the GM mustard hybrid seed is essential for eliminating fertile plants that are not transgenic in the hybrid seed production plots to maintain the purity of hybrid seed. The use of herbicide will be limited to seed production stage by the seed producing company/institute and not during the commercial cultivation of DMH-11 by the farmers. The use of herbicide will be after obtaining label claim and approval from Central Insecticide Board & Registration Committee (CIB&RC). The biosafety research trials including environmental safety studies have been conducted for transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11 …the issue of environmental release of GM Mustard is under adjudication in the Writ Petition (Civil) 115/2004 and Writ Petition(Civil) 260 of 2005 titled as Gene Campaign Vs. UoI & Ors. and Aruna Rodrigues Vs. UoI & Ors., respectively before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India,” he added.
On December 5, over 100 medical professionals from different disciplines wrote to PM Narendra Modi about the concerns around the herbicide tolerant quality of DMH 11.
“In the case of GM mustard, a patently untenable claim is being made including in submissions to the Supreme Court that the herbicide glufosinate will only be used for seed production and that farmers will be prevented by legislation from spraying it for weed control. Illegal HT cotton and illegal spraying of the dangerous herbicide glyphosate has been taking place for the past decade or more, without Governments being able to stop it. Once environmentally released, GM mustard will spread and so will the use of glufosinate. Our entire population consumes mustard as seeds, leaves and oil. As medical professionals, we feel it is our duty to warn about the serious adverse impacts of Herbicide Tolerant GM crops,” they wrote in the letter.
According to US based non-profit Beyond Pesticides, herbicide tolerant crops are designed to tolerate specific broad-spectrum herbicides, which kill the surrounding weeds, but leave the cultivated crop intact. In case of DMH 11, that herbicide is glufosinate ammonium.
In response to another query on GM Mustard, Choubey said, “Globally Genetically Engineered (GE) crops are cultivated in 190.5 million ha of which HT crops occupy 85.1 million hectares i.e., about 45% of the global transgenic crop area. In USA, HT corn, HT cotton and HT soybean area increased and over the past 25 years, and today more than 90% of area under these crops are HT varieties.”

Efforts have been on for more than 60 hours now.
The boy, identified as Tanmay Sahu, fell into the borewell while playing in a farm around 5pm on December 6. His father, Sunil Sahu, told reporters that his son was playing in the farm and went to another field where he fell into the open borewell.
He said that his daughter, 12, was the one who saw him falling. “We immediately rushed to the spot. He was breathing and we listened to his voice as we enquired. The rescue operation was started from 6 pm onwards on December 6,” he said.
According to the latest available information, authorities said that the boy was no longer responding and might have fallen unconscious. Earthmoving machines were brought in to dig a parallel tunnel to get the boy out of the borewell and a little over 30-feet-tunnel has been dug so far.

“The Rescue operation for the eight-year-old boy who fell into the borewell is still underway. Excavation is going on and about 33 feet of excavation have been done,” Betul Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Shyamendra Jaiswal told news agency ANI earlier.
“We have a target to reach 45 feet and then dig a tunnel. It might take some time as there are hard stones in the way. The child, however, is not responding as he might have fallen unconscious. Efforts are on to save the boy,” he added.
State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Home Guard, and local police personnel are present on the spot to ensure that the rescue operation is continuously progressing.
Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also directed the officials to make adequate arrangements to bring the boy out safely.

They won in Gujarat because...: Uddhav Sena's dig at BJP's Gujarat feat; 'Modi Gujarat Asmita',https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-won-in-gujarat-because-uddhav-sena-s-dig-on-bjp-s-gujarat-feat-modi-gujarat-asmita-101670550917705.html,"Maharashtra played a crucial role in BJP's historic win in Gujarat as development projects originally planned to be in Maharashtra eventually went to Gujarat ahead of the election, former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday. In its editorial on Friday, Sena mouthpiece Saamana reiterated that the Gujarat result has not been surprising despite Gujarat's situation during the pandemic or the recent Morbi accident. Snatching projects from states like Maharashtra paid off, it said.
Full coverage of Gujarat Election
Calling PM Modi the 'gaurav-purush' of Gujarat, Saamana said Gujarat has been on the path of steady progress because of PM Modi. ""Many global meets have been held in Gujarat and world leaders visit Sabarmati, Ahmedabad because of PM Modi. Many big-ticket projects have been snatched from states like Maharashtra to offer to Gujarat. All these paid off in the election. Sardar Patel statue is there in Gujarat but PM Modi is Gujarat Asmita (identity of Gujarat),"" the editorial said.
Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday issued a statement and said the projects that went from Maharashtra to Gujarat helped the BJP. ""They (BJP) only won in Gujarat because Maharashtra projects shifted there and these projects helped in their victory. Maharashtra Deputy CM and CM sold these projects to Gujarat for elections and now they are selling our villages to Karnataka for elections,"" Uddhav said.
Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said BJP's Gujarat result was expected but that did not reflect the mood of the country. Many decisions were taken for the convenience of Gujarat and projects were shifted to the state, he said. ""BJP's victory is only the outcome of this,"" Pawar said.
Ahead of the election, three projects allegedly went from Maharashtra to Gujarat including Vedanta-Foxconn project, bulk drug park and Tata-Airbus aircraft project.

"India will not be an ally of US, it will be another great power: White House official",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-not-be-an-ally-of-us-it-will-be-another-great-power-white-house-official-101670548930518.html,"India will not be an ally of the United States but will be another great power, a top White House official said Thursday asserting there is no other bilateral relationship that is being ""deepened and strengthened"" more rapidly than between the two countries over the last 20 years.
Responding to a question on India during his appearance at the Aspen Security Forum meeting here, Kurt Campbell, the White House Asia coordinator, said that in his view India is the most important bilateral relationship for the United States in the 21st century.
“The fact is, I don’t know of any bilateral relationship that is being deepened and strengthened more rapidly than the United States and India over the last 20 years,” the top White House official told a Washington audience.
The United States needs to invest even more of its capacity, and building in people to people ties, working together on technology and other issues, he said.
“India has a unique strategic character. It will not be an ally of the United States. It has a desire to be an independent, powerful state and it will be another great power. But I think there are reasons to believe that our strategic alignment is growing across the board in almost every arena,” Campbell said.
There are inhibitions in both of the bureaucracies and there are many challenges, he noted.
“But I do believe that this is a relationship that should have some ambition. We should look at things that we can do together, whether it's in space, whether it's education, whether it's on climate, whether it's on technology, and really move in that direction,” he said.
“If you look over the last 20 years and look at the hurdles that have been surmounted and the depth of engagement between our two sides, it’s remarkable,” he said.
India-US relationship, he asserted, is not simply built on anxiety around China. “It is a deeper understanding of the importance of the synergies between our societies,” he said, adding that the Indian diaspora here is a powerful connection.
Campbell acknowledged that Indians were ambivalent when President Joe Biden and his administration decided to take the Quad to the leader level.
“There were probably voices in their bureaucracy that were against it. But when President Biden made the direct appeal repeatedly to Prime Minister Modi, they decided that this was in their interests,” he said.
The US is working very constructively with its Indian partners on the major set of initiatives in COVID-19 vaccine delivery, in maritime domain awareness and education, the White House official said.
“I'm thrilled to say that Prime Minister Albanese of Australia has invited us in 2023 for a major Quad meeting that we think will extend our coordination, cooperation, not just in Southeast Asia, and the Indo Pacific as well,” he said.
“I'm very bullish on the Quad. I think it will remain an unofficial venue. But it has many lines of communication, and it's led to strengthening and deepening of coordination between these four key maritime democracies,” Campbell said.
The Quad, known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is a group of four countries: the United States, Australia, India, and Japan.
