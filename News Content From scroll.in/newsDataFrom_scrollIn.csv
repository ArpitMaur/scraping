"Hardships faced by public cannot be seen as fault of demonetisation, Centre tells Supreme Court","Dec 06, 2022 · 11:15 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1039123/hardships-faced-by-public-cannot-be-seen-as-fault-of-demonetisation-centre-tells-supreme-court,"Hardships faced by the public due to demonetisation cannot be considered a fault of the Centre’s 2016 decision to ban currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations, Advocate General R Venkataramani told the Supreme Court on Monday, reported the Hindustan Times.
“Difficulties and issues that might have arisen in the course of giving effect to the notification and the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, cannot be said to be flaws, affecting the decision-making process,” Venkataramani told a five-judge Constitution bench that is hearing 58 petitions challenging the demonetisation move.
On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease to be legal tender in India from midnight. Modi had said that the decision had been taken to “fight corruption, black money and terrorism”.
Several persons, many of them elderly, had died while standing in long queues to exchange their money. As millions of families were left stranded with no cash, many even killed themselves after failing to exchange old notes for valid currency.
The petitioners have claimed that the exercise violated several constitutional rights of citizens, such as the right to property (Article 300A), right to equality (Article 14), right to carry on any trade, business or occupation (Article 19) and right to life and right to livelihood (Article 21).
On Monday, the attorney general said that it was not appropriate to consider only hardships faced by the public when the the government was addressing problems such as fake currency, black money and terror funding that had posed challenges to the country, reported Live Law.
He claimed that the government was successful in striking a balance between addressing these challenges and considering the social and economic distress caused by the decision.
“I am not saying that hardship has to be completely ignored,” Venkataramani said, according to Bar and Bench. “Hardships will inevitably happen, I am not closing my eyes to that at all. The government also did not close its eyes to it.”
The attorney general also said that even if the initial objective of the exercise was not achieved, the entire policy cannot be invalidated.
“Every minute of governance looks at targets,” he said. “The five-year plan has targets and then over a period of time, targets are either met or not met for a number of reasons.”
Venkataramani also argued that the cutoff date of December 30, 2016, fixed by the Centre to deposit old currency notes did not violate the fundamental rights of citizens.
“In all instances of fixation of a particular date, it stands to reason that there will be persons on both sides of the said line and those who are left out will be aggrieved by their exclusion,” he said. “As long as any exclusion is not deliberate or discriminatory, court will not test the validity of a cut-off date.”
Venkataramani added that the question raised on whether the government should explore non-currency management measures for addressing problems of black money and other matters is not subject to judicial review.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/166842-dohahiiktk-1637937757.jpg
Madras High Court orders ban on mobile phones inside temples,"Dec 03, 2022 · 12:17 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038932/madras-high-court-orders-ban-on-mobile-phones-inside-temples,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday asked the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department to ban the use of mobile phones inside all the temples in Tamil Nadu to maintain “purity and religious sanctity”, The New Indian Express reported.
The court issued the order in response to petitioner M Seetharaman from Tiruchendur in Thoothukudi district, who sought a ban on phones as devotees take pictures and film videos.
He has argued that cell phones could compromise the security of temples and that men could photograph women without their consent.
The petitioner cited the example of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai where the ban has been adopted – the devotees are asked to keep their cell phones in lockers.
After hearing the petitioner, a division bench of Justices R Mahadevan and J Sathya Narayana Prasad noted that the Tiruchendur temple had already taken measures to ban cell phones on the premises.
The judges also said that there cannot be any dispute under Article 25 of the Constitution (Freedom of Religion), The Hindu reported. However, such freedom to act and practise can be subject to regulations, inside the premises of the temple, they added.
The temple authorities should ensure that the decency of worship and sanctity of the temple are maintained, the court said. Therefore, using mobile phones and cameras inside the premises, which diverts the attention of the devotees from the purpose of visiting the temple, can be regulated by the temple authorities, it added.",https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/81601-kypmzmfodu-1518247954.jpg
"More than 16 crore Indians will face adverse effects of heatwaves from 2030, says World Bank","Dec 01, 2022 · 01:26 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038765/more-than-16-crore-indians-will-face-adverse-effects-of-heatwaves-from-2030-says-world-bank,"More than 16 crore Indians will face adverse effects of heatwaves from 2030 and approximately 3.4 crore persons will lose jobs due to heat-induced decline in productivity, a World Bank report said on Wednesday.
The heatwaves will shoot up the need for cooling, increasing the demand for air conditioners and other equipment. It will also prompt India to look for alternative and innovative cooling systems, the report said.
This need will open an investment opportunity of $1.6 trillion (over Rs 129 lakh crore) by 2040 besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly and creating 37 lakh jobs, it said.
These observations were made in the World Bank’s “Climate Investment Opportunities in India’s Cooling Sector” report. It proposed a roadmap to support the India Cooling Action Plan 2019 through new investments in building construction, cold chains and refrigerants.
The report said that devising climate-responsive cooling techniques in private and government-funded constructions could ensure that underprivileged persons are not impacted by rising temperatures.
To reduce power consumption by 20%-30%, the bank has proposed a policy for district cooling technologies like generating chilled water in a central plant and distributing it to multiple buildings through underground insulated pipes. Such a system is cost-effective, it said.
The report also suggested framing guidelines to implement local and city-wide urban cooling measures such as cool roofs.
To reduce food and pharmaceutical wastage during transport due to higher temperatures, the report recommended fixing gaps in cold chain distribution networks. Investing in pre-cooling and refrigerated transport could help decrease food loss by about 76% and reduce carbon emissions by 16%, it said.
The improvements needed to bring cost-effective measures will also create 2 lakh jobs for trained technicians over the next two decades and reduce the demand for refrigerants by around 31%, the report added.
“India’s cooling strategy can help save lives and livelihoods, reduce carbon emissions and simultaneously position India as a global hub for green cooling manufacturing,” said Auguste Tano Kouamé, the World Bank’s Country Director in India.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/173768-domynsphji-1651318429.jpg
NCP leader Nawab Malik denied bail in money laundering case,"Nov 30, 2022 · 04:58 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038691/ncp-leader-nawab-malik-denied-bail-in-money-laundering-case,"A special court in Mumbai on Wednesday refused bail to former Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik in a money laundering case involving fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim and his aides, reported PTI.
The Enforcement Directorate arrested the Nationalist Congress Party leader on February 23. Special Judge RN Rokade rejected his plea on Wednesday.
On November 14, the court had reserved the order in the case after hearing the arguments from both the sides.
Rokade was initially supposed to pass the order on November 23, but the court said that it had to go through large amounts of submissions in the case, reported The Indian Express.
Malik is in judicial custody and has been in a private hospital in Mumbai since May. The former state Cabinet minister had mentioned in his bail plea that there is no predicate offence against him to prosecute him for money laundering, reported PTI.
The Enforcement Directorate, however, opposed the bail stating that a case registered by the National Investigation Agency against Dawood Ibrahim, his sister Haseena Parkar and their associates is considered a predicate offence.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/165585-smxdaudjfw-1635234548.jpg

The BJP won 25 seats, while Independent candidates secured victories in the remaining three constituencies.
With the elections results, the hill state has continued its tradition of voting out incumbent governments after each term. The last time that the state voted an incumbent government back to power was in 1985.
While the Congress surged comfortably ahead of the BJP in terms of seats, it was only marginally ahead in terms of vote share. The Congress got 43.9% of the votes, while the BJP received 43% of the popular mandate.
Other parties and Independents garnered 10.39% of the votes, while new entrant Aam Aadmi Party secured just 1.10% of the mandate.
Chief Minister Jairam Thakur tendered his resignation to Governor Rajendra Arlekar. He asserted that he would never stop working for the development of the state’s residents.
Thakur noted that the BJP lost the Himachal Pradesh elections by a difference of just 1% in vote share. “Congress won with least vote share in the state’s history,” he said, according to ANI. “But I respect the poll results. Hope Congress elects their chief minister soon and starts working for the state.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing BJP workers at the party headquarters, expressed gratitude to voters in Himachal Pradesh. He also said that the party lost by a very small margin.
Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra thanked the residents of Himachal Pradesh for the party’s win in the state. “Best wishes to all Congress leaders and workers,” she said on Twitter. “Your hard work bore fruit.”

"Choice of mother ultimate in cases involving fetal abnormalities, says Delhi High Court","Dec 06, 2022 · 02:29 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039152/choice-of-mother-ultimate-in-cases-involving-fetal-abnormalities-says-delhi-high-court,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday held that the choice of a mother is ultimate in pregnancy cases involving fetal abnormalities, Live Law reported.
Justice Prathibha M Singh made the observation while allowing a 26-year-old married woman to terminate her pregnancy of 33 weeks.
The woman had approached the court after she found out that the fetus was suffering from certain cerebral abnormalities and her request for an abortion was declined by Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan citing the advanced stage of pregnancy, reported Bar and Bench.
Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, abortion is permitted till 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, in September, a Supreme Court ruling expanded it to 24 weeks.
On Tuesday, Justice Singh, in her ruling, said that abortion rights have been a subject of debate across the world, reported PTI.
“India is amongst the countries that recognize the choice of a woman in its law and have even expanded this right in recent times with amendments permitting the termination at an advanced stage under various circumstances,” the judge said.
She also added that with the emergence of modern technology to detect abnormalities in an unborn child, the issues surrounding abortion are bound to become complex.
“Such technology coupled with the unpredictability of degree of an abnormality, even by medical practitioners, throw challenges to the manner in which a society may grow in the future,” Justice Singh said.
The court also acknowledged that women undergo a “severe dilemma” while taking a decision to terminate pregnancy in such cases, according to Live Law.
“Courts are no exception,” Justice Singh added. “Judges have to grapple with issues that are not merely factual and legal, but also involve ethical and moral factors.”
She also stressed on the importance of the report of the medical board constituted in such cases.
“Such opinions [by medical boards] cannot be sketchy and fragmented. They ought to be comprehensive in nature,” the judge said, according to Bar and Bench.
The court had previously expressed displeasure over the medical report submitted by the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan in the case, noting that it was incomplete.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/169438-lzfwdhkegu-1643435731.jpg
"Communal polarisation in India defeats Narendra Modi’s G20 declaration, says Sitaram Yechury","Dec 06, 2022 · 12:31 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039121/communal-polarisation-in-india-defeats-narendra-modis-g20-declaration-says-sitaram-yechury,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s declaration for India’s G20 presidency that New Delhi would promote “universal sense of oneness” can be realised only if increased polarisation and economic downslide in the country is brought to a halt, Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said at an all-party meeting on Monday.
India assumed the presidency of G20, or Group of 20 countries, on December 1. The presidency of the intergovernmental forum comprising the world’s major developed and developing economies is assumed by member countries on a rotational basis.
On Monday, Modi had convened an all-party meeting seeking their cooperation to make India’s presidential tenure a success in the lead up to the G20 summit scheduled to be held in the country in 2023.
Leaders of 15 parties spoke at the event with many of them underlining that India had become the G20 president by rotation, and that the government should not project it as an achievement, The Hindu reported.
In his speech, Yechury said that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – which the government projects as its principle for the preisdency – does not mean imposing uniformity but is the recognition of a global family where social pluralities are celebrated. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is a Sanskrit phrase that means the world is one family.
At the meeting, Modi announced that a domestic political campaign programme around the theme “One Earth-One Family-One Future” will be carried out during India’s one-year presidency.
To this, the CPI(M) general secretary said: “The realisation of the theme announced by the government will be determined by correcting these current alarming trends in social, political, and economic spheres and strictly adhering to our constitutional foundations of liberty, equality, and fraternity that define the character of our secular democratic republic.”
Chinese incursions should be in focus, says Congress
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said at the meeting that New Delhi should leverage its G20 presidency to push Beijing to put an end to its incursions within India’s borders, The Times of India reported.

Slogans on doors of rooms assigned to faculty members ask them to go back to “shakha”, a reference to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the students’ union affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, blamed the Left-leaning groups for the graffiti.

Assam petroleum workers to resume fuel supply to Meghalaya after getting assurance of safety,"Nov 25, 2022 · 11:56 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038305/assam-petroleum-workers-stop-fuel-supply-to-meghalaya-amid-reports-of-violence,"Members of a petroleum workers’ union in Assam decided to resume transporting fuel to Meghalaya on Friday, a day after it stopped the services in view of reports of attacks on vehicles in the neighbouring state, reported PTI.
On Thursday, the Assam Petroleum Mazdoor Union had written to oil marketing companies informing them that its members will not load fuel on to tankers. The union had said that vehicles with number plates from Assam are being attacked in Meghalaya.
The attacks took place over the last couple of days after five villagers and an Assam Forest Guard official were killed in firing by the Assam Police along the state’s border with Meghalaya. After the firing, several cases of stone-throwing have been reported from Meghalaya, and at least five vehicles from outside the state have been set ablaze in different parts of the state.
The union decided to resume transporting fuel after Meghalaya authorities assured that its drivers, tankers and staff would be safe. “But we have also told them that if any untoward situation happens, we will immediately stop the vehicles once again,” Ramen Das, the general secretary of the union, told PTI.
Das said he has put forth conditions to resume the services, including not sending tankers to Meghalaya after dusk till the situation normalises. He added that seven tankers with petroleum products have left for the neighbouring state from the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Betkuchi depot in Guwahati.
After the union’s decision on Thursday to stop services, the Meghalaya government had directed local authorities to give police protection to trucks transporting essential items and oil tankers entering the state from Assam, according to PTI.
State Food and Civil Supplies Director Pravin Bakshi gave the directions in letters addressed to the deputy collectors of at least seven districts. “Necessary arrangements for patrolling/providing police escorts wherever possible may kindly be explored on all national highways to ensure smooth movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities,” Bakshi wrote.
Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday had assured Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma of a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the firing incident. Shah said that a similar request was made by Assam.

The awards were instituted in 2000 by the non-profit to recognise individuals working for the protection of wildlife and natural habitats in India.
This year, the first prize was awarded to photographer Anirban Dutta for clicking a swarm of termites around a street lamp in Cooch Behar as a Black Drongo bird swoops to pick morsels.
“This dream-like image masks the chaos of its setting – a busy petrol pump,” the award citation read. “The photographer merged three images using in-camera multiple exposures, but the image was created in his mind before it was captured.”
Photographer Abhijit Somvanshi won the second prize for capturing a face-off between a pair of Indian jackals and a Hawk Eagle at the Pench Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh.
“The eagle accepted the interlopers’ challenge, attacking and locking one of the jackals in a fierce fight while the other quietly began eating,” the citation read. “Eventually, the tussle ended mutually, with them accepting each others’ presence as they shared the meal.”
The third prize was awarded to photographer Anand Boraa for clicking a leopard who was trying to get away from humans attempting to catch it. The photograph was shot in Nashik.
“A local political leader jumped into the fray in a badly calculated attempt to catch the cat,” the citation read. “Though injured, he escaped with his life. As did the leopard that was safely trapped and released by forest officials.”

Jamia violence: Delhi HC gives Centre a week to reply on transferring probe to independent agency,"Nov 29, 2022 · 04:23 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038589/jamia-violence-delhi-hc-gives-center-a-week-to-reply-on-transferring-probe-to-independent-agency,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday gave the Centre a week to reply to an amendment application seeking to transfer the investigation against students and officers in the Jamia Millia violence case from police to an independent agency, Live Law reported.
The application to which the Centre has to reply has demanded an inquiry by the Special Investigation Agency Team.
On December 15, 2019, violence had erupted on the Jamia Millia Islamia campus during the student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Delhi Police was accused of barging into the university campus and using excessive force to quell the demonstrations. The police claimed its action was justified as the protestors had allegedly injured its personnel and set buses on fire.
The police have booked student activists Sharjeel Imam, Safoora Zargar, Mohammed Ilyas, Belaal Nadeem, Shahzar Raza Khan, Mahmood Anwar, Mohammed Qasim, Umair Ahmad, Chanda Yadav and Abuzar in the case.
The Delhi High Court has been hearing a batch of petitions filed by lawyers, students of Jamia Millia Islamia University and residents of Okhla in south Delhi since 2019. However, so far no complaint has been filed against the police officials who attacked the students.
On October 19, the Supreme Court had asked the High Court to hear the matter about the alleged police brutality at the campus.
Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioners, had requested the judges to file the first information report against the police in the matter that has been pending before the Delhi High Court for nearly three years now.
However, the Supreme Court had said that it has “doubts about invoking” its jurisdiction in the issue. Gonsalves then requested the division bench to ask the Delhi High Court to finish the hearing within three weeks.
On Tuesday, the division bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh listed the matter for December 13.",https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/132885-chhykmibsg-1576588679.jpg
India abstains from UNSC resolution to allow humanitarian aid to sanctioned entities,8 hours ago,https://scroll.in/latest/1039437/india-abstains-from-unsc-resolution-to-allow-humanitarian-aid-to-sanctioned-entities,"India on Friday abstained from voting on a resolution in the United Nations Security Council to allow humanitarian aid to sanctioned entities around the world.
The resolution was tabled by the United States and Ireland, according to PTI. It proposed an exemption under which the processing or payment of funds and the provision of goods and services needed to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance would not be considered as violations of sanctions.
India, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, was the only country that abstained from the vote. All 14 other members of the council voted in favour of the resolution.
Ruchira Kamboj, India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that the country’s concerns “emanate from proven instances of terrorist groups taking full advantage of such humanitarian carve-outs, and making a mockery of sanction regimes, including that of the 1267 Sanctions Committee”.
Under the United Nations 1267 Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee regime, any member state of the world body can propose that an individual or an entity be declared as a terrorist or terrorist group.

Kamboj said that terrorist outfits must not be allowed to misuse the garb of humanitarian cover to expand their activities. She added that such exemptions must not lead to mainstreaming of terrorist organisations.
“There have...been several cases of terrorist groups in our neighborhood, including those listed by this Council, re-incarnating themselves as humanitarian organisations and civil society groups precisely to evade these sanctions,” the statement by India read. “These terrorist organisations use the umbrella of the humanitarian assistance space to raise funds and recruit fighters.”

“Clearly, there were ulterior motives behind the attack,” Vijayan said. “It was done with the intention of disrupting peace and co-existence.”
Fishermen, under the aegis of the Latin Catholic diocese of Thiruvananthapuram, have been protesting for the last few months against the Rs 7,500-crore project led by billionaire Gautam Adani’s ports business. They have alleged that the project is causing coastal erosion and hit their livelihoods.
The protest took a violent turn on Saturday after demonstrators prevented the Adani Group from resuming construction at the project site, which has been suspended for the last four months. The construction at the port was resumed on the directions of the Kerala High Court.
On Sunday, a first information report was registered against Thiruvananthapuram Archbishop Thomas Netto, Auxiliary Bishop R Kristudas and 13 other Latin Catholic priests in connection with Saturday’s violence.
The fishermen community also alleged that the police took five men in custody.
Later that day, the protestors attacked the Vizhinjam police station, demanding the release of those arrested. According to the police, the protestors held officials hostage, vandalised furniture and damaged several vehicles parked on the police station premises. According to the police, 36 personnel were injured.
Subsequently, a case was filed against 3,000 persons in connection with the violence.
On Thursday, Vijayan claimed that the protestors had beforehand declared they would attack the police station.
“If the vandals were not able to achieve their ends, it was only because of the exemplary and courageous restraint shown by the police,” the chief minister said, according to Onmanorama. “People who expected the police to come down heavily on the agitators could not have been more wrong.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/136380-ymppvahdjn-1617888452.jpg

Mitra, a former West Bengal minister, also claimed that Gujaratis did not fight for India in its independence struggle.
“Gujarat has no role [in India’s Independence movement], but today Gujaratis are becoming prime ministers and shouting ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ [slogans],” she alleged. “Do they have the right to shout ‘Bharat mata ki jai’.”
Mitra claimed that only those who fought in Independence movement have the right to shout the slogan.
“We can shout the slogan,” she added. “The BJP has no right”.
The Trinamool Congress legislator also described Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah as Duryodhan and Dushashan, the antagonists from epic Mahabharata.
According to the epic, Duryodhan, the King of Kauravas, had ordered his brother to disrobe, albeit unsuccessfully, Draupadi, the wife of the Pandava brothers.
“You [Modi and Shah] have no work to do, other than doing vastraharan [act of disrobing] of ladies,” she alleged.

Rijiju’s statement came at a time when the government and the judiciary are in a tussle on the process of making judicial appointments in the country. Rijiju himself has repeatedly criticised the existing collegium system of appointments.
In 2015, the Supreme Court had struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act passed by Parliament months after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister in 2014. The court had deemed the law unconstitutional.
The National Judicial Appointments Commission proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
On Thursday, Rijiju clarified the government’s stand on the National Judicial Appointments Commission in response to a question asked by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Communist Party of India leader John Brittas.
The law minister added that the Union government appoints only those persons as judges who are recommended by Supreme Court collegium. The minister also said that as of December 5, recommendations made by the collegium to appoint one Supreme Court judge and eight High Courts judges are pending with the government.

SC allows Mumbai Metro to seek civic authority’s approval to cut 84 trees at Aarey Colony,"Nov 29, 2022 · 07:52 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038621/sc-allows-mumbai-metro-to-seek-civic-authoritys-approval-to-cut-84-trees-at-aarey-colony,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited to approach civic authorities for permission to cut 84 trees in the city’s Aarey Colony, PTI reported.
The MMRCL said that it needs to cut the trees to enable the construction of ramps for the trains at the metro car shed.
A bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha allowed the authority to approach the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s Tree Authority, Live Law reported. The court allowed the Tree Authority to decide on the MMRCL’s application by imposing any conditions that may be suitable.
The bench noted that the Bombay High Court had prima facie held the felling of trees as well as the decision to move the car shed to Aarey Colony to be legally valid.
“In such projects involving large outlay of public funds, the court cannot be oblivious of the serious dislocations caused if the public investment which goes into the project is disregarded,” the judges said. “Undoubtedly, the concerns relating to environment are important, as all development must be sustainable.”
During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the original total cost of the project was Rs 23,000 crore, and that it had increased to Rs 37,000 crore due to litigation. He said that the construction of the metro project would reduce vehicular traffic, and thus cut down carbon emissions.
On the other hand, senior advocate Chander Uday Singh, appearing for a group of activists, told the court that the figure of Rs 23,000 crore represents the cost of the entire project, and not just the car shed. He also referred to committee reports that said that a site in Mumbai’s Kanjurmarg area was a more suitable spot for the car shed.
The dispute
In October 2019, the Supreme Court had ordered a status quo on the project after a group of law students wrote to Ranjan Gogoi, who was then the chief justice of India, asking him to intervene and stop the cutting of trees in what is considered the last remaining green lung of Mumbai.
In November 2019, the Maharashtra government, led by Uddhav Thackeray, had stopped work on the Aarey car shed. On October 11, 2020, Thackeray had announced that 800 acres of land in the Aarey Colony would be declared a reserve forest and that the car shed for the metro project in the area would be relocated to Kanjurmarg.
However, after Eknath Shinde took over as the new chief minister of Maharashtra in July, heoverturned Thackeray’s decision to shift the Metro-3 car shed out of the Aarey Colony.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/127646-wwbykxihed-1568912390.jpg
"Bilkis Bano moves SC against remission of life sentences of 11 rape, murder convicts","Nov 30, 2022 · 02:28 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038554/bilkis-bano-moves-sc-against-remission-of-life-sentence-of-11-rape-murder-convicts,"Bilkis Bano on Wednesday filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the premature release of 11 men convicted of gangraping her and murdering her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots, Live Law reported.
Bano has also filed a review petition against the Supreme Court’s judgement in May allowing the Gujarat government to decide on the remission of the life-term sentences of the convicts. Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud told Bano’s lawyer Shobha Gupta that he would look into the listing of the two petitions.
The top court is already hearing two other petitions challenging the remission granted to the convicts. These two pleas have been filed by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Subhasini Ali, journalist and filmmaker Revati Laul as well as Professor Roop Rekha Varma.
The men were freed on August 15 from a Godhra jail after the Gujarat government approved their application under its remission policy. On the same day, the convicts were greeted with sweets by their relatives after their release. A member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had felicitated them as well, causing outrage.
An affidavit submitted by the Gujarat government in the Supreme Court in October showed that the Central government’s Minister of Home Affairs had also endorsed the premature release. The state said its decision to release the convicts was based on them spending 14 years in jail and their good behaviour during their time in prison.
The 11 men had gangraped Bano in a village near Ahmedabad on March 3, 2002, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. She was 19 and pregnant at the time. Fourteen members of her family were also killed in the violence, including her three-year-old daughter whose head was smashed on the ground by the perpetrators.
At Wednesday’s hearing, Advocate Gupta raised doubts on whether Justice Ajay Rastogi, who has been hearing the other pleas against the remission, would be able to hear the petitions filed by Bano as he is now part of a Constitution bench, PTI reported. Rastogi had also authored the judgement allowing the Gujarat government to decide on the early release of the 11 convicts.
In response, Chief Justice Chandrachud said: “The review has to be heard first. Let it come before Justice Rastogi.”
Advocate Gupta then sought an open court hearing on the petitions filed by Bano. The chief justice, however, said that only the judges who will be listed to take up the pleas can decide on the matter.

“Even in the twenty-first century, we are left grappling with casteism and classification based on caste is made even in matters of burial of the dead,” the court noted. “This situation has to change and the change should be for the better.”
A division bench of Justices R Subramanian and K Kumaresh Babu made the observation while hearing a dispute over burying bodies in Navakurichi village of Salem district.
Separate burial grounds have been made in the village for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Backward Class communities, according to The New Indian Express. In its order, the bench set aside a judgement of a single judge who had ordered the exhumation of a body that was said to have been buried on a plot of land which was not designated as a burial site.
The judges noted that as per laws, burial is prohibited in a panchayat only within 90 metres from habitation or drinking water sources.
It held that in absence of any prohibition under the law, it could not agree with the previous court’s order to exhume bodies.
The bench, however, cautioned that the “no prohibition” criteria should not be used as a license to bury or dispose of bodies anywhere, Live Law reported.
“Wherever there are designated places for burial and burning of the corpse, burial and burning must be restricted to those designated places unless there is a custom in the village or area concerned to use any other place for burial or a burning of corpses,” it said.
In 2019, the Madras High Court asked why common burial or cremation grounds could not be established when entry to temples had been opened up to everyone irrespective of their castes.
At the time, it had questioned the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to allot different burial and cremation grounds for Dalits.
In 2021, the court again directed the state government to consider constructing common burial ground in every village.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/166447-bkveytlzue-1637076643.jpeg

She suggested December 11 to December 15 as alternative dates for her questioning in the case.
On December 1, the Enforcement Directorate had named Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, in the liquor policy case. The agency has alleged that the MLC was part of a “south group” that paid at least Rs 100 crore in kickbacks to leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party through businessman Vijay Nair, who has been arrested in the case.
A day later, the Central Bureau of Investigation issued a notice to Kavitha. On December 3, she sought the copies of the complaint that the CBI provided her.
In a letter to Central Bureau of Investigation Deputy Inspector General Raghavendra Vatsa, Kavitha on Monday wrote that she has gone through the documents, including the first information report, but her name is not mentioned anywhere.
While seeking to defer the questioning, the MLC said that she will cooperate with the investigation.
The case
On August 17, the Central Bureau of Investigation had booked Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and 14 other persons on charges of irregularities in a new liquor policy.
Under the new policy, which was implemented in Delhi on November 17 last year, licences of 849 liquor shops were issued to private firms through open bidding. However, on July 30, the Delhi government withdrew the policy after Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommended an inquiry into it by the central agency.

The organiation’s member named Nasir Pasha had filed the plea through his wife, as he is currently in judicial custody.
Justice M Nagaprasanna of the High Court passed the verdict at 3 pm, but the detailed judgement has not yet been released on public domain.
The Popular Front of India, along with its associates, was banned for five years by the government under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on September 28.
A government notification alleged that the Muslim organisation along with its eight affiliates have been involved in “violent terrorist activities” and intended to create a reign of terror in the country, endangering security and public order.
In the petition, Pasha contended that under Section 3(3) of the UAPA, the government needed to cite separate and distinct reasons for implementing the ban with immediate effect. He claimed that the organisation was banned by means of a composite order and no separate reason was cited in accordance with the Act, according to Live Law.
The petition claimed that the order was passed suddenly, and that the Popular Front of India was not given an opportunity to dispute it. It contended that giving immediate effect to such moves would give unbridled power to law enforcement authorities to false implicate anyone by alleging that the person is a member of a terrorist organisation.
“The immediate effect further curtails the right of defence before the tribunal but also exposes every member, follower, sympathiser to possible criminal action, when effect is such grave and deterrent, then reasons should be equally convincing and strong,” the petition said.
Meanwhile, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, told the court that reasons had been cited in the notification to ban the organisation, and that there was nothing illegal about the order.
The Centre also alleged that the organisation had been engaging in anti-national activities, and had colluded with terrorist outfits to indulge in violence.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183656-eivciaipsm-1669814463.jpg

Justices MR Shah made the statement on a plea filed by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay seeking directions to the Union and state governments to take steps to prevent black magic, superstition and forceful religious conversions.
A bench of Justices Shah and CT Ravikumar is hearing the matter.
On Monday, the court noted that alluring citizens to convert to other religions by offering medicines and food grains was a serious matter.
“If you believe that particular persons should be helped, help them but it can’t be for conversion,” Shah said. “Allurement is very dangerous. It is a very serious issue and is against the basic structure of our Constitution. Everyone who stays in India, will have to act as per the culture of India.”
To this, Ravikumar added: “And religious harmony as well.”
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that even the Constitution does not allow wrongful propagation of religion by a citizen.
Mehta also said the Centre has been gathering data from the states on religious conversion. He told the judges that several states have made laws to form committees which determine whether the conversions were “in lieu of of grains, medicines or whether it is a real religious change of heart”.
The solicitor general also told the court that Gujarat had introduced a stringent law against illegal conversions but the High Court has stayed some of its provisions.
The Gujarat High Court had put a stay on several sections of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act on August 19, 2021. The law had been passed in April last year to stop the “emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion”.
Last week, the Gujarat government moved the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
On Monday, the Supreme Court bench, however, said that it cannot consider Gujarat’s application in the case if its special leave petition is not listed in the present plea. Meanwhile, the court also refused to take up applications on the maintainability of the petition after the matter was raised twice, reported Bar and Bench.
The court will hear the case next on December 12.
In his petition, Upadhyay has argued that the victims of forced religious conversions are often socially and economically underprivileged, particularly belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes.
This not only offends Articles 14 (equality before law), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the Constitution but is also against the principles of secularism, which is an integral part of the basic structure of Constitution, he submitted.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/136934-miledugenw-1616056721.jpg

He also asked whether people would “cook fish for the Bengalis” with their gas connections. Rawal made the statement while campaigning for the BJP in the city of Valsad.
“If gas cylinders get expensive, they will become cheaper again,” the former BJP MP from the Ahmedabad East constituency said. “If inflation goes up, it will come down. People will get employment too. But what if Rohingya migrants and Bangladeshis start living around you, like in Delhi?”
Rawal further said: “What will you do with the gas cylinders? First cook fish for the Bengalis?”

The actor-turned politician also criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for offering “freebies” to the residents of Gujarat. “People queue up to offer donations here, and you offer lollipops of freebies to them?” he remarked.
“He [Kejriwal] comes here in a private plane, and then travels in an autorickshaw for show,” Rawal said. “We have spent our lives in acting, but we have not seen such nautanki [drama].”
The BJP leader accused the Aam Aadmi Party chief of “distributing biryani at Shaheen Bagh”.
In late 2019 and 2020, the locality of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi was the site of a large sit-in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. A large proportion of the protestors were Muslim women.

Electoral bonds are monetary instruments that citizens or corporate groups can buy from a bank and donate to any eligible political party, which can then redeem them for money.
The scheme was announced by former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who claimed that the central government wanted to clean up political funding and make it a transparent process. However, the entire process is anonymous since no one is required to declare their purchase of these interest-free bonds and political parties do not need to show the source of the money.
In response to an RTI application filed by transparency activist Retired Commodore Lokesh Batra, the finance ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs has said that electoral bonds worth more than Rs 10,791 crore have been sold since the roll out of the scheme in 2018.
Over Rs 2,742 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold by the State Bank of India in Mumbai, followed by over than Rs 2,387 crore in Kolkata and more Rs 1,885 crore in Hyderabad. The government-owned bank is the only entity authorised to sell electoral bonds.
The lowest sale of electoral bonds valued at Rs 80 lakh was recorded in Patna, RTI data shared by the activist showed.

Of the electoral bonds worth Rs 10,791 crore that have been sold, Rs 10,767 crore of the monetary instruments were encashed. The remaining amount – Rs 23.68 lakh – went to Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.
The highest amount of over Rs 6,748 crore (62.68% of the total amount) was encashed in Delhi, followed by more than Rs 1,384 crore (12.85%) in Hyderabad and 1,012 crore (9.41%) in Kolkata, the RTI reply showed.
Of the total number of electoral bonds sold, 10,108 were valued at Rs 1 crore or above. The highest number (2,643) of electoral bonds with a denomination of more than Rs 1 crore were sold in Mumbai, followed by Kolkata (2,152) and Hyderabad (1,815).
The electoral bonds of denomination of Rs 1 crore and above made up 51.78% of the total 19,520 monetary instruments sold.
Pointing out that electoral bonds having denomination of Rs 1 crore and above constitute 93.67% of the total donations made under the scheme, Batra claimed that it showed that big corporates are buying the monetary instruments for political parties.
“The big question is would they not look for returns from political parties for huge donations?” he asked.
The activist also said that the irony of the scheme is that donors do not need to pay any service charge or even cover the cost of printing the electoral bonds, and the government or in effect, the tax payers bear the cost “for enabling transactions of ‘anonymous tax-free funding’ to political parties”.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/117318-eturzrptfs-1580193274.jpg

The airport said that operations were disrupted for about 40 minutes because of a server failure. Normal services have now resumed, it said.
Earlier, airport authorities said they had initiated manual processing of passenger information to enable them to board flights.
However, due to the network interruption, passengers had to wait for nearly an hour to deposit their baggage at check-in counters, according to the Hindustan Times.
Shrikant Kishore, deputy inspector general with the Central Industrial Security Force, said that the system outage took place due to damage to optic fibre cables.
“Due to the server down at Mumbai International Airport, the crowd is slightly more than normal,” the Central Industrial Security Force said. “The crowd is being managed well and there is no chaos as manual passes are being issued.”
A spokesperson for Akasa Air also confirmed to the Hindustan Times that the airline’s services had been affected. “We are assisting passengers according to their needs,” the spokesperson said.
Currently, Terminal 2 is being used both for international and domestic flights.

“Why do we always want to portray that religious festivals are the time for riots?” Chnadrachud questioned. “Let us look at the good which happens in country. See Maharashtra during Ganesh Puja lakhs gather but there are no riots.”

The court asked whether the police had been given powers to sort out land disputes, The Indian Express reported. “If someone has an issue, he will go to the police station, pay a bribe and get someone’s house demolished,” Justice Kumar observed. “Why don’t you close the court, civil court?”
The petitioner’s lawyer claimed that some persons were putting pressure on his client to vacant a plot of land, and that a false case had been registered against her. The judge said in response: “Bahut achche [very nice]… I am here to protect you, not trouble you.”
The court stayed proceedings in connection with the first information report, and told the police not to arrest Devi or her family members.
“We will get you Rs 5 lakh compensation from the pockets of each [official responsible for the demolition]” Justice Kumar orally observed. “…Police aur CO milkar ghar tudva raha hai ghoos lekar [police and circle officer are taking bribes to demolish homes].”
In recent months, authorities have on several occasions resorted to using bulldozers to demolish the houses of persons accused of crimes. However, there are no legal provisions that allow for the demolition of a house as a punitive measure.
Most instances of such demolitions have taken place in states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. In Bihar, a coalition of the Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress is currently in power.

Gujarat Assembly polls: BJP promises to set up anti-radicalisation cell if voted back to power,"Nov 26, 2022 · 05:36 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038396/gujarat-assembly-polls-bjp-promises-to-set-up-anti-radicalisation-cell-if-voted-back-to-power,"The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday promised to start an anti-radicalisation cell for “anti-national” persons in Gujarat if the party is voted back to power in the upcoming Assembly elections.
BJP President JP Nadda released the party’s manifesto in Gandhinagar today.
“Anti-radicalisation cell would identify and eliminate threats of destabilisation, sleeper cells of radical groups, terrorist organisations and anti-India forces,” Nadda said.
Although the senior party leader did not specify any group, his comments came a day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the Gujarat government had taught a lesson to “anti-social elements” in 2002.
“They tried to create a problem for [Prime Minister] Narendra Bhai [Modi], but he taught them such a lesson that they have not dared to do anything till 2022,” Shah said, while addressing an election rally in Mahudha town of Kheda district. “The BJP government has established peace in Gujarat.”
During Saturday’s event, Nadda also said that the state government will bring in a law to recover damages done to public or private properties by “anti-social elements”. The party has also promised to implement the recommendation made by the judicial committee to bring in Uniform Civil Code in the state.
A Uniform Civil Code involves having a common set of laws governing marriage, divorce, succession and adoption for all Indians, instead of allowing different personal laws for people of different faiths.
The aim of such uniformity is meant to ensure equality and justice for women in particular, who are often denied their rights in marriage, divorce and inheritance under patriarchal personal laws.
The Assembly polls in Gujarat will be held in two phases on December 1 and December 5, while the results will be declared on December 8 along with the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183444-myoqxtkckb-1669460612.jpg
Centre stops Maulana Azad fellowship for scholars from minority communities,Yesterday · 11:32 am,https://scroll.in/latest/1039366/centre-stops-maulana-azad-fellowship-for-scholars-from-minority-communities,"The Centre on Thursday said it has decided to discontinue the Maulana Azad National Fellowship, a scholarship for students from minority communities, from this academic year.
Union Minority Affairs Minister Smriti Irani said that the decision was made as the fellowship overlapped with other schemes.
The Maulana Azad National Fellowship was launched in 2009. It provided financial assistance to students from six notified minority communities – Buddhists, Christians, Jains, Muslims, Parsis and Sikhs – to pursue MPhil and PhD.
The scheme was launched as part of measures to implement the recommendations of the Sachar Committee, which studied the socio-economic condition of Muslims in India, according to The Hindu.
On Thursday, Irani told the Lok Sabha that government provides fellowship for higher education through various schemes, including the Maulana Azad National Fellowship.
“All these Schemes, except MANF [Maulana Azad National Fellowship], are open for candidates of all communities including minorities but the data of fellowship distributed among minority students is captured only under the MANF scheme,” Irani said. “Since the scheme overlaps with other fellowships...and minority students are already covered under such schemes, the government has decided to discontinue the MANF scheme.”
Irani provided the information in a written reply to questions put forth by Congress MP TN Prathapan.
Prathapan, however, told The Hindu that he will raise the issue in the Parliament.
“This is injustice,” he said. “A number of researchers will lose their chance to study further by this step.”
National Students Union’s Jamia Millia Islamia president NS Abdul Hameed said the move will adversely affect Muslim, Sikh and Christian students who are not considered as Other Backward Classes in some states.
“The scholarships for minorities, OBCs, Dalits and Adivasis used to get overlapped as the applicants may be from same social or religious backgrounds,” Hameed said, according to The Hindu. “We have been demanding the Centre to correct the anomalies. Instead of correcting the anomalies, they stopped the scholarship altogether.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/172758-zdibuwjrjp-1649410838.jpg
Madhya Pradesh Police arrest author of book with purported ‘objectionable content’ about Hindus,"Dec 08, 2022 · 02:41 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039310/madhya-pradesh-police-arrest-author-of-book-with-purported-objectionable-content-about-hindus,"Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Thursday said that the state police has arrested the author of a book who was charged with promoting enmity and hurting religious feelings, PTI reported.
Mishra was referring to Farhat Khan, who wrote the book titled Collective Violence and Criminal Justice System. The book was published by Amar Law Publications.
Khan was booked on December 3 after members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had protested at the Government New Law College in Indore. The ABVP is the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
Members of the ABVP had alleged that Khan’s book contains objectionable content against Hindus and Hindutva outfits such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal and that it was being taught to students since 2017.
ABVP members had alleged that the book talks about the emergence of “Hindu communalism as a destructive ideology”. The book also mentions that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindutva outfits seek to establish a Hindu-majority state and want to “enslave other communities”, they had claimed.
Besides Khan, the police had filed a case against Amar Law Publications, the principal of the college Inam Ur Rahman and a professor named Mirza Mojiz Baig.
The case was filed under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 295A (acts intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code.
On Thursday, the Madhya Pradesh home minister said that Khan was arrested in Pune.
“The controversial writer, Farhat Khan, was arrested in Pune when she was undergoing dialysis in a hospital there,” Mishra told reporters, according to PTI.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Kumar Singh said that teams were sent to several places in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra to trace Khan.
“On the basis of leads, we traced her to Pune and served her a CrPC [Code of Criminal Procedure] notice, as per which she was asked to cooperate in the probe and remain present in court at the time of submission of the chargesheet,” he said, according to PTI.
He added that the Indore-based author was suffering from a serious kidney ailment and needed dialysis on a regular basis.
Previously, Hitesh Khetrapal, a representative of Amar Law Publications, had said that the first edition of the book was published in 2015.
“When we came to know about its controversial parts in 2021, we discussed it with its author Dr Farhat Khan and got the related pages of the book changed,” he had said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/165566-csxklmddyo-1635163627.jpg
Israeli director stands by comments on ‘Kashmir Files’ but clarifies he didn’t want to insult anyone,"Dec 01, 2022 · 07:11 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038806/totally-apologise-if-remarks-misconstrued-israeli-filmmaker-on-comments-about-kashmir-files,"Israeli director and the head of the International Film Festival of India’s jury Nadav Lapid on Wednesday said he stood by his criticism of The Kashmir Files but clarified that he did not mean to insult the Kashmiri Pandit community or those who had suffered, CNN-News18 reported.
At the closing ceremony of the festival on Monday, Lapid had denounced the film directed by Vivek Agnihotri as “propaganda” and a “vulgar movie”. Lapid added that he and other jury members had been “shocked and disturbed” that the film had been included in the event’s International Competition section.
After his remarks triggered a controversy, Israel’s Ambassador to India Naor Gilon alleged that Lapid had abused the hospitality of the festival organisers, and that he should be ashamed for his comments.
Agnihotri said that he would quit direction if Lapid as well as “intellectuals and urban Naxals” who supported his criticism could prove that the events depicted in the movie were false.
In an interview to News18 on Wednesday, Lapid said that he had “never denied the tragedy of Kashmir” or the sufferings of the residents of the region.
“I didn’t want to insult anyone, and my aim was never to insult people or their relatives, who have suffered,” said the Israeli filmmaker. “I totally apologise if that’s the way they interpreted.”
Lapid, however, stuck to his criticism of the film and maintained that this was also the opinion of the other jury members.

However, Sudipto Sen, a member of the jury, said that Lapid’s views were “personal”, according to News18. He also claimed that the Israeli filmmaker did not say what he originally intended to at the event.
“Nadav’s English is not very strong so he had a written statement,” Sen said. “But suddenly we were told he was not reading out what was decided, he has written his own speech. We had discussed the merits of all films and those discussions are not supposed to go out of the jury’s room.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183713-kzzggvnhcd-1669899057.jpg
Vivek Agnihotri apologises to HC for accusing Justice S Muralidhar of bias in Gautam Navlakha case,"Dec 06, 2022 · 12:04 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039136/vivek-agnihotri-apologises-to-delhi-hc-for-remarks-about-justice-s-muralidhar,"Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri on Tuesday tendered an unconditional apology to the Delhi High Court for his comments accusing Justice S Muralidhar of being biased after he passed an order in 2018 to quash transit remand and house arrest of activist Gautam Navlakha in connection to the Bhima Koregaon case, reported Bar and Bench.
The apology came on a contempt case initiated by the Delhi High Court in 2018 against Agnihotri and former Reserve Bank of India Director S Gurumurthy, who had also made similar allegations. Justice Muralidhar was a judge of the Delhi High Court in 2018. He is currently the chief justice of the Orissa High Court.
In August 2018, the Pune Police had detained Navlakha from Delhi in the Bhima Koregaon case and obtained a transit remand to take him to Maharashtra to put him under house arrest. In October that year, Justice Muralidhar had set aside the transit remand and ordered that Navlakha be released from house arrest.
After the order, Agnihotri had tweeted alleging Muralidhar of being biased. Meanwhile, Gurumurthy, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue, had tweeted the link to an article which claimed that the judge’s wife was a close friend of Navlakha.
The High Court then initiated contempt proceedings against both of them.
In an affidavit submitted before the High Court on Tuesday, Agnihotri claimed that he had deleted his tweets about Muralidhar. The amicus curiae in the case, however, submitted that the tweets had been taken down by Twitter and not deleted by Agnihotri.
Despite the apology, a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh directed Agnihotri to appear before the court when the matter is taken up next on March 16, 2023.
“We are asking him [Agnihotri] to remain present because he is the contemnor,” the court said. “Does he have any difficulty if he has to express remorse in person? The remorse cannot always be expressed by way of an affidavit.”
Navlakha is one of the accused persons in the Bhima Koregaon case, which pertains to caste violence in a village near Pune in 2018. The 70-year-old activist was among 16 people arrested for allegedly plotting the violence.
Last month, he was put under house arrest after being released from Taloja Jail in Navi Mumbai, where he had been lodged for more than two years. On November 10, the Supreme Court had allowed Navlakha to be placed under house arrest for a month. This was after the activist filed a plea seeking to be shifted from jail on the grounds of ill health and poor facilities in prison.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183934-ydvtpnqusf-1670307180.jpeg

The accused man, Harpreet Singh, was arrested at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. The agency had declared a reward of Rs 10 lakh for Singh.
One person was killed and five others were injured in the blast. The police had said that they suspect that the man who died on the second-floor toilet of the court complex was trying to assemble or plant an explosive device.
A National Investigation Agency spokesperson said that Singh, along with an associate of Lakhbir Singh Rode, the Pakistan-based chief of the International Sikh Youth Federation, were the main conspirators in the blast.
The International Sikh Youth Federation is a banned organisation that seeks to establish an independent homeland for the Sikh community.
“Acting on the directions of Rode, Singh coordinated the delivery of the custom-made Improvised Explosive Device, which had been sent from Pakistan to his India-based associates, that was used in the blast,” the spokesperson said, according to PTI. “Further investigations in the case are in progress.”
Singh was also involved and wanted in various cases, including smuggling of explosives, arms and narcotics, the spokesperson added.
The investigating agency has already arrested three more persons – Surmukh Singh Sammu, Dilbagh Singh Baggo and Rajanpreet Singh – in connection with the blast, reported The Indian Express.
Of these, Rajanpreet Singh had allegedly given the IED to Gagandeep Singh Gaggi, a dismissed Punjab Police official who had died trying to allegedly plant or assemble the explosive.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/167992-sniynvddmg-1640403618.jpg

Gujarat moves SC to lift High Court stay on some sections of anti-conversion law,"Dec 04, 2022 · 08:08 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039009/gujarat-moves-sc-to-lift-high-court-stay-on-some-sections-of-anti-conversion-law,"The Gujarat government on Saturday urged the Supreme Court to lift the stay imposed by the High Court on certain sections of the state’s amended anti-conversion law, PTI reported.
In August last year, the Gujarat High Court had put a stay on several sections of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act on August 19, 2021. The law had been passed in April last year to stop the “emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion”.
The legislation is an amendment to the state’s Freedom of Religion Act of 2003.
In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the Gujarat government has said that the law passed in 2003, and more particularly Section 5 of the Act, has been “holding the field for the last 18 years” to achieve the objective “to maintain the public order”.
Section 5 of the law states that priests must take prior permission from the district magistrate for converting any person. The person who wishes to get converted also needs to inform the district magistrate in a prescribed form.
The Gujarat government made the submission in response to a petition filed by advocate and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. He has sought directions to the Union and state governments to take steps to prevent black magic, superstition and forceful religious conversions.
In Saturday’s affidavit, the government said that the requirement of taking prior permission prevents forcible conversion and protects the freedom of conscience guaranteed to the citizens.
“It is submitted that the steps stipulated in Section 5 are the precautions to ensure the process of renouncing one religion and adopting another is genuine, voluntary and bona fide and free from any force, allurement and fraudulent means,” the government said in the affidavit.
The government also added that freedom of religion does not include a fundamental right to convert people to other faiths.
“The said right certainly does not include the right to convert an individual through fraud, deception, coercion, allurement or other such means,” it said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/160779-tceexznmrz-1624640203.jpg

The Assembly polls in Gujarat will be held in two phases on December 1 and December 5. The results will be declared on December 8. The Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Aam Aadmi Party are the main contenders in the polls.
An analysis of the reports on the two phases published by the Association for Democratic Reforms on November 24 and November 28 showed that 330 of the 1,621 candidates contesting the polls have declared criminal cases against themselves.
This is an increase in such declarations from the 2017 Assembly elections when 238 candidates had criminal cases against them.

The analysis showed that 60 of the 179 candidates from the Congress have been named in criminal cases, while the figure stood at 32, out of 182 candidates, for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
Forty of the Aam Aadmi Party candidates have serious criminal cases against them, the Congress has 28 such candidates and the BJP 25. The Association for Democratic Reforms defines serious crimes as non-bailable offences that attract a maximum punishment of five years and more. These are crimes related to assault, murder, kidnap and rape, as well as crimes against women and corruption cases.
BJP’s Jetha Bharwad, contesting the Shehra seat, has been accused of rape. Five candidates have declared cases related to murder.

The Association for Democratic Reforms said that the directions given by the Supreme Court have not had any effect on political parties as 21% of the candidates vying in the first phase of polling, and around 20% in the second phase, have criminal cases against them.
In February 2020, the Supreme Court had passed an order directing political parties to cite reasons for selecting candidates having criminal history and as to why those who did not have any such records were not considered.
The Association for Democratic Reforms also said that the data shows that political parties “have no interest in reforming the electoral system and our democracy will continue to suffer at the hands of lawbreakers who become lawmakers.”

The court was hearing a plea seeking directions to law enforcement agencies to specify guidelines on seizure, examination and preservation of digital and electronic devices and their contents.
“The world has changed, the CBI must also change,” commented Justice SK Kaul, who is part of a bench that also comprises Justice AS Oka.
At Monday’s hearing, Senior Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, told the court that the CBI manual has been kept in a sealed cover and is not accessible.
“Any procedure that is meant to protect the citizen cannot be lying in a sealed cover in an office,” she submitted. “What the CBI procedure says we don’t know.”
Ramakrishnan argued that other agencies constantly update their manuals to deal with the challenges to privacy.
In response, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju said that the manual is available on the internet. To this, the court asked him why the manual has kept in a sealed cover if it is publicly accessible.
“There is some resistance from the department,” Raju replied.
The matter will now be listed after February 7, the judges said.
The petition
The petition has been filed by five academics – Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ram Ramaswamy, Savitribai Phule Pune University professor Sujata Patel, professor of Cultural Studies at Hyderabad’s English and Foreign Languages University Madhava Prasad, professor of Modern Indian history at Jamia Millia Islamia Mukul Kesavan and theoretical ecological economist Deepak Malghan.
The petitioners have sought directions to the investigating agencies and the police, including seeking permission from a judicial magistrate before accessing or seizing electronic devices and specifying how the material is relevant or linked to the alleged offence.
In the case of urgent seizures, the petition submitted that reasons for not seeking permission should be provided to the owner of the device in writing. The owner of the electronic device should not be forced to reveal passwords, ideally, a copy of the hard drive should be taken and not the original, and the hard disks must be examined in the presence of the owner of the device.
The plea also mentioned that several persons from whom devices have been seized in alleged offences registered in the recent past belong to the academic field or are noted authors.
“The academic community does and stores its research and writing in the electronic or digital medium, and the threat of damage, distortion, loss or premature exposure of academic or literary work in the event of seizure of electronic devices is considerable,” the petition added.
In November, the Centre had said in an affidavit that right to privacy is not absolute and can be subjected to restrictions. It had argued that any blanket order regarding the return of digital and electronic devices of a person under investigation would be inappropriate",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/165739-gazfudcltg-1646754834.jpg

The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister made the statement while addressing a youth convention of the party in Srinagar.
“In 1947, people of Kashmir had no guns but they fought the raiders from Pakistan successfully,” Mufti said. “I warn the BJP not to act like raiders in Kashmir. People know how to fight such raiders.”
On October 26, 1947, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, signed an agreement with India called the Instrument of Accession. Under the agreement, Jammu and Kashmir became a part of the Indian Union with the Centre’s law-making powers over the state restricted to just three subjects – defence, external affairs and communications.
Maharaja Hari Singh had signed the agreement amid a tribal invasion of the erstwhile princely state that was supported by Pakistan.
On Sunday, the Peoples Democratic Party chief remarked that India is not synonymous with the BJP. “The India which we joined is Jawaharlal Nehru’s India, [MK] Gandhi ji’s India, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s India, it is the India of Rahul Gandhi who is travelling the country for Hindu-Muslim unity, it is Tushar Gandhi’s India,” she said, according to PTI.

“I swear by Allah whatever the BJP snatched from us on August 5 will be brought back with interest,” she said. “The PDP is moving ahead on the roadmap of [PDP patron] late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and will take his mission to its logical end.”
On August 5, 2019, the Centre abrogated Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution. While Article 370 gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Article 35A granted the erstwhile state’s legislature the power to define the “permanent residents” of the state and provide them with special rights and privileges.
The erstwhile state was also bifurcated into two Union Territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – following the August 5 decision.

Sameer Vyas, son of Jay Narayan Vyas, also joined the party at an event that was attended by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in Ahmedabad.
Jay Narayan Vyas had quit the BJP on November 5. “People sitting in the organisation are desirous of fighting elections and are indulging in factionalism,” the former minister had told ANI. “They are targeting leaders one by one in order to remove and replace them.”
At the time, the 75-year-old had said that he will contest the elections from Sidhpur constituency but not as an Independent candidate.
On Monday, Jay Narayan Vyas said that BJP’s decision to replace Gujarat chief ministers over the last few years and to change the entire Cabinet in 2021 was not in the interest of the state, reported PTI.
“I felt this party [Congress] does not think about keeping a person at the center, even elects its presidents through a democratic process and only one name is not used for the post,” the politician told PTI. “Only the Congress functionaries decide who should be the leader, and no external factor like the Sangh is involved.”

On Saturday, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar urged voters to cast their ballots in large numbers in the second phase of the Gujarat elections on December 5. “The possibility of surpassing 2017 voting percentage now lies in their increased participation only,” the poll panel said.

The Election Commission said that there was a “conspicuous gap” between rural and urban constituencies in terms of voter turnout.
“The gap of voter turnout is as wide as 34.85% if it is compared in rural constituency of Dediapada in Narmada district which has recorded 82.71% and that in urban AC of Gandhidham in Kuchchh district which has witnessed 47.86% of voter turnout,” it said. “Also, average turnout in important urban areas is lower than turnout in rural constituencies.”
The poll panel noted that the voting percentage declined in all three Assembly constituencies in the Rajkot city as compared to the 2017 elections. The decline in Rajkot West was “very sharp” at 10.56%, it said.
The Election Commission said that all seats in Gujarat that recorded a turnout of more than 65% were rural ones, whereas not even a single urban constituency crossed the 65% mark.
“To address the urban apathy trend across the country, the Commission has directed all CEOs [Chief Electoral Officers] to identify low voter turnout ACs and Polling stations to ensure targeted awareness interventions to increase voting percentage,” the poll panel said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183841-uhqotlumbf-1670139200.jpg
Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu to be next Himachal Pradesh chief minister,An hour ago,https://scroll.in/latest/1039383/sukhvinder-singh-sukhu-to-be-next-himachal-pradesh-chief-minister,"Congress MLA Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu was on Saturday named the Himachal Pradesh chief minister, reported ANI.
Party leader Mukesh Agnihotri will be Sukhu’s deputy, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel announced. The decision was taken at a Congress legislature party meeting held on Saturday evening.
The oath taking ceremony will be held on Sunday at 11 am, Baghel added.
The Congress on Thursday won the state Assembly elections by securing 40 out of 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party won 25 seats, while Independent candidates secured victories in the remaining three constituencies.
Sukhu, who was elected as an MLA from Nadaun in Hamirpur district, was the party’s campaign committee chief in Himachal Pradesh. He is also the former chief of the Congress state unit and is considered close to party MP Rahul Gandhi, reported NDTV.
On Saturday, Sukhu thanked party leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and the state residents, reported ANI. Our govt will bring change. He said that it is his responsibility to fulfil the promises made to the residents and that his government will work for the development of the state.
“I started my political career at the age of 17 years,” he added. “I will never be able to forget what the Congress party has done for me.”
Meanwhile, supporters of Congress MP Pratibha Singh staged a protest after speculation grew that Sukhu would be named the as the next chief minister.

Singh was being seen as the most-likely contender for the top post. A Lok Sabha MP, Singh did not contest the polls but led the party as its state unit chief. She claims the support of MLAs loyal to her husband Virbhadra Singh, who died in July last year.
Agnihotri and five-time MLA Harshwardhan Chauhan were also seen as front runners. Given a varied number of options for the top post, the Congress had feared horse-trading as the party saw itself emerging as the winner during the counting of votes on Thursday.
With the victory in the elections, the hill state has continued its tradition of voting out incumbent governments after each term. The last time that the state voted an incumbent government back to power was in 1985.
While the Congress surged comfortably ahead of the BJP in terms of seats, it was only marginally ahead in terms of vote share. The Congress got 43.9% of the votes, while the BJP received 43% of the popular mandate.
As it became clear that the Congress would wrest control of the state, Chief Minister Jairam Thakur tendered his resignation to Governor Rajendra Arlekar. He asserted that he would never stop working for the development of the state’s residents.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184171-fkqrurvgdi-1670681710.jpg

In an urgent hearing, a single-judge bench of Justice Yashwant Varma ordered social media platforms to ensure that the video is not shared, distributed, forwarded or posted any further.
“Bearing in mind the sexually explicit nature of the contents of that video and taking into consideration the imminent, grave and irreparable harm that is likely to be caused to the privacy rights of the plaintiff an ad interim ex parte injunction is clearly warranted,” Justice Varma said in his order.

At Wednesday’s hearing, Justice Verma noted that the court had taken cognisance of the video on November 29 and the registrar had asked the central government to block it, according to Live Law.

"Karnataka Waqf Board to start schools and colleges for girls, hijab to be allowed","Dec 01, 2022 · 04:27 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038777/karnataka-waqf-board-to-start-schools-and-colleges-for-girls-hijab-to-be-allowed,"The Karnataka Waqf Board is planning to set up schools and colleges for girls and women in ten districts of the state, The Indian Express reported on Thursday.
The chairperson of the board, Moulana Shafi Saadi, said that students will be allowed to wear hijab in the institutions.
Saadi said that the proposal was not linked to protests in the state seeking the right to wear hijabs in educational institutions, India Today reported.
“This decision was taken before,” he said. “Everybody is allowed to get admission to this college. There will be general school and college rules and it will follow university guidelines.”
The schools and colleges will be set up in the districts of Mangaluru, Udupi, Kodagu, Shivamogga, Chitradurga, Bagalkote, Vijayapura, Kalburgi, Chikkodi, and Nippani.
The institutions will offer education from the kindergarten level to the professional degree level. The institutions will be constructed on Waqf land for Rs 25 crore, which will be borne by the board.
A waqf is a property given for a religious, educational or charitable cause by Muslims. In India, waqfs are governed under the Waqf Act, 1995. Each state has a Waqf Board led by a legal entity, which is vested with the power to acquire, hold and transfer property.
Commenting on the Karnataka Waqf Board’s proposal, Sanjay Badaskar, a member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, questioned the rationale behind setting up such institutions.
“Aren’t there enough government schools and minority schools in the state?” he asked, according to The Indian Express. “What is the need to establish more schools that will be run by Muslims? This is nothing but another form of the madrasa and a form of polarization. Allowing hijabs in such institutions is to make their narrative stronger.”
Badaskar claimed that Hindu students and staff members would face discrimination in institutions set up by the Waqf Board. “We will oppose this tooth and nail,” he said.
Hijab protests

On February 5, the Karnataka government passed an order to ban clothes that “disturb equality, integrity and public order” in educational institutions. This was after students in many parts of the state were barred from attending classes while wearing hijabs.
On October 13, the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict on a group of petitions that challenged the order.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/171287-cmtxoetpkz-1646841858.jpg

The members of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike were protesting at Hire Bagewadi against the Belagavi Police for denying them entry into the city to stage a protest against the Maharashtra government.
According to the police, 400 members of the outfit were detained.

Tensions are high in Belagavi because of the border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra.
The dispute dates back to the period between the 1950s and 1960s when the states were formed. Maharashtra claims that 865 villages on the border should have been merged with it, while Karnataka claims that the demarcation that was carried out on linguistic lines in 1956 is final.
The Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition by the Maharashtra government challenging some provisions of the State Reorganisation Act, 1956, and demanding that 865 villages in the border areas be merged with it.
On Tuesday, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike president TA Narayana Gowda alleged that some members of his outfit were assaulted by the police.
“I wonder if we are living in Karnataka or some other state,” he said, according to The Hindu. “Why should the police use force against pro-Kannada activists? They have violated our fundamental right to peaceful protest in Belagavi city. This is unacceptable.”
Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said he has expressed his displeasure over the targeting of vehicles from his state with Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, reported The Indian Express.
“We are extremely disappointed with the developments at Belagavi and such incidents at Hirebagwadi near Belagavi are not acceptable,” Fadnavis told the Karnataka chief minister, according to a statement from his office.
The Maharashtra deputy chief minister added that Bommai assured him of strict action against those responsible for the attack.
Meanwhile, political leaders in Maharashtra said that the Centre should intervene at the earliest.
Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said that MPs from Maharashtra should meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.
“Despite CM [Eknath] Shinde’s talk with Karnataka CM, he has not shown any softness on the [Belagavi] issue,” Pawar said, according to ANI. “One must not test our [Maharashtra’s] patience and this should not go in the wrong direction.”
Bharatiya Janata Party MP Udayanraje Bhosale said that the Centre should speak with all political leaders from Maharashtra and Karnataka, reported The Indian Express.
“Today, just making statements and counter statements by Maharashtra and Karnataka leaders is not going to solve the vexed problem,” Bhosale said. “It has to address by taking all leaders into confidence. Dialogue is must.”
Maharashtra ministers cancel Belagavi visit
Meanwhile, Maharashtra ministers Chandrakant Patil and Shambhuraj Desai on Tuesday cancelled their visit to Belagavi scheduled for Tuesday.
They were slated to meet activists from the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, an organisation that has been seeking the merger of about 800 villages with Maharashtra.
“We both decided to postpone our Belgavi visit today to avoid any untoward incident,” Desai said, according to The Indian Express. “The stone pelting on the Maharashtra vehicles is condemnable…that too at a time when we are showing patience.”
On Monday, Bommai had asked his Maharashtra counterpart Eknath Shinde not to send his cabinet colleagues to the border district of Belagavi.

"Covid vaccine deaths: Centre says immunisation is voluntary, people must make ‘informed decisions’","Nov 29, 2022 · 01:58 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038565/covid-vaccine-deaths-centre-says-immunisation-is-voluntary-people-must-make-informed-decisions,"The health ministry has told the Supreme Court that making the government compensate for deaths due to adverse events after Covid-19 immunisation is “not legally sustainable”.
The ministry, in an affidavit filed in response to a petition seeking compensation for immunisation-related death, said that it has never forced any citizen to take vaccines. It added that the exercise was voluntary.
The affidavit added that compensation can only be given by a manufacturer when the vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. People getting immunised after the market authorisation have to seek compensation individually in civil courts, the government said.
India rolled out its adult vaccination programme against Covid-19 in January 2021, a year after the pandemic broke out globally. Till November 19, more than 219 crore doses have been administered across the country. There have been 92,114 cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), or side effects to vaccines. Of these, 2,782 were serious and severe in nature. The government has maintained that not all of them are linked to vaccination.
In October 2021, Hyderabad-based Rachana Gangu and Coimbatore-based Venugopalan Govindan filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court demanding significant monetary compensation following their daughters’ deaths.
Gangu’s daughter Rithaika Omtri died in June 2021 in Hyderabad within a fortnight of taking a Covishield shot. Her death was later confirmed to be linked to the Covishield vaccine by a national committee that looks into cases of adverse events.
Govindan’s daughter Karunya, aged 20, died in July 2021 within a month of vaccination in Coimbatore. The national committee could not find sufficient evidence to link her death with vaccination.
In the petition, the parents demanded that the government establish a protocol for early detection and treatment of adverse events and that it set up an expert medical board to investigate their daughters’ deaths.
In August, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre asking it to respond to the writ petition. The Union government submitted its response on November 25.
Asking the court to dismiss the petition, the government said that the adverse event monitoring, investigation and analysis system is adequate and transparent. It added that an independent review of the deaths of the petitioner’s children would cast doubts on the existing AEFI mechanism.

So far, India has approved 12 vaccines against the Covid-19 virus. Covishield has accounted for the bulk of immunisation. The ministry said that it had released details of the side-effects of Covishield and the possibility of death through its website, press releases and various news articles in PTI.
“Therefore any person taking vaccine has to verify said information and then decide whether to get vaccines or not,” the affidavit stated.
In their petition, Gangu had claimed that no information was provided by the Hyderabad vaccination centre about possible adverse events after immunisation.
The government has, however, stated that this is an incorrect submission and that question of informed consent does not come in cases of voluntary vaccination. In its affidavit, the health ministry has put the onus of deriving more information on the vaccine recipients.
“A vaccine beneficiary always has the option to access even more information about the vaccine and its possible adverse effects from the health workers at the vaccination centre or their doctor before making an informed decision on their own,” the affidavit said. “Once a vaccine beneficiary who has access to all relevant information, voluntarily chooses to enter a vaccination centre and receive vaccination, the question of lack of informed consent does not arise.”
Rithaika Omtri died in June 2021, a fortnight after receiving her first Covishield shot. She suffered vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.
Govindan, the co-petitioner, said the government’s response in court was shocking. “In the affidavit, the government claims that adverse events such as blood clots were publicised and people knew,” he said. “But the fact is that the government publicised the vaccines as completely safe and effective without any riders, misleading people like us and sending my daughter and many others to their untimely deaths.”
After his daughter’s death, Govindan claimed that they tried approaching the government. However, they were met with callous responses and the AEFI process was in shambles, he alleged.
He also said they will file a response to the government’s affidavit to counter each point.
Several experts have pointed towards a poor AEFI system in India which has led to underreporting of adverse events. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Chile, and Paraguay have reported a higher rate of AEFI due to Covid vaccines.
Rushil Tamboli, from the Awaken India Movement, which has been pushing for better government response to adverse events and has helped families seek legal action, said that the government has forced states to take certain actions to mandate vaccination.
“The government has lied about its efforts to raise awareness. The information is limited and difficult to find on their website,” Tamboli said. “For compensation they are asking families to reach out to civil courts, and that the government will not be responsible to provide any compensation… in a sense they are shirking away from their own responsibility.”
Gangu, the main petitioner, told Scroll.in that the government is not been transparent about recording and reporting adverse events in her daughter’s case. She and her husband had to file three right to information queries with the Karnataka government and the Centre to get information on Rithaika’s death.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/167950-bsxgsnuexr-1640319465.jpg

Kuleba added that New Delhi’s decision to allow Russian oil imports was morally inappropriate.
“If you benefit because of our suffering, it would be good to see more of your help addressed to us,” he told the channel.
Kuleba said that India’s decision on importing fuel from Russia must be seen through the prism of human suffering in Ukraine. “It is not enough to point fingers at the European Union and say, Oh, they are doing the same thing,” he said, according to NDTV.
The Ukrainian foreign minister was responding to a comment by his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar about Europe’s oil imports from Russia. Jaishankar had said on Monday that from February to November, the European Union had imported more fossil fuel from Moscow than India.

Kuleba said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement to Russian President Vladimir Putin that this was “not the time for war” was an encouraging one. However, he said that India needed to be more direct while referring to the conflict in Ukraine.
“We are waiting for the moment when Indian foreign policy will call spade a spade, and name the conflict – not ‘war in Ukraine’, but what it is, a ‘Russian aggression against Ukraine’,” the Ukrainian foreign minister said, according to NDTV.
New Delhi has increased its oil imports from Moscow significantly since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February. In September, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that India’s crude oil shipments from Russia had risen to 12% from about 2% in February.
Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, in what it claimed was a special operation to demilitarise and “de-Nazify” the east European country. Moscow had captured large tracts of territory in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine but has had to retreat from some of them due to the European country’s counter-offensive.

Under stage III of the plan, the restrictions include a ban on construction and demolition activities, except for essential projects concerning national security, defence, railways and metro rail, among others.
The development came after the national capital’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 407 at 4 pm, according to PTI.

The domes were located on the Nanjangud/Ooty National Highway bus stop. The earlier design had three domes that were painted golden. Now, only the central dome has been retained and painted red.
On November 14, BJP MP from Mysuru-Kodagu constituency Pratap Simha had told authorities to demolish the structures within three days, failing which he would bring them down himself with a bulldozer.
However, BJP MLA SA Ramadass had claimed that the domes were modelled on the Mysuru Palace and were designed to conserve the city’s heritage. Ramadass is the MLA from the Krishnaraja Assembly constituency, within which the bus stop is located.
On Sunday, Simha thanked Ramadass for getting the dome-like structures removed, The Times of India reported. “If there is a big dome in the middle and two smaller domes next to each other, it is a mosque,” he said. “Thanks to the DC [Deputy Commissioner] who asked for time and kept his word and to Ramdas ji who understood the reality and bowed to the public opinion.”
Meanwhile, Ramadass said that unnecessary communalisation of the matter had hurt him, according to The Indian Express.
On November 15, the National Highways Authority of India had directed the Mysuru City Corporation to demolish the dome-like structures, claiming that they had been constructed in an unauthorised manner.

A division bench comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar held that although certain discussions may have taken place during the meeting, they did not lead to any decision.
“Collegium is a multi member body whose decision is a resolution,” the bench said. “The consultation [of the Collegium in that meeting] was not concluded and was, therefore, adjourned.”
During Friday’s hearing, the court also said that only the final decision of the collegium was required to be uploaded on the Supreme Court website, and not the discussions that took place during its meetings.
The petition had cited a October 3, 2017, resolution of the collegium that had decided to share its decisions on its website whenever recommendations are sent to the government, reported Bar and Bench. However, the plea argued that on December 12, 2018, a meeting of the collegium was held in which certain decisions were taken, but no information about it was uploaded on the website.
Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, argued that the information regarding appointments and recommendations by the Supreme Court collegium could not be regarded as a protected class of documents.
The plea cited an interview of former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur, who was part of the collegium meeting in December 2018. The former judge had alleged that a decision to recommend the elevation of two High Court Chief Justices was finalised in the meeting, but it was later changed after his retirement.
However, a resolution of the January 10, 2019 collegium meeting had recorded that the decision of December 12, 2018 was revisited in the light of additional material, reported Live Law.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/182489-lzqrepanfj-1667838964.jpg
Pro-Kannada groups protest in Belagavi after student was allegedly beaten for waving Karnataka flag,"Dec 01, 2022 · 06:26 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038800/pro-kannada-groups-protest-in-belagavi-after-student-was-allegedly-beaten-for-waving-karnataka-flag,"Pro-Kannada outfits protested in Karnataka’s Belagavi on Thursday, demanding action against persons who allegedly beat up a student after he waved the state flag during an inter-college festival, The Indian Express reported.
A video of the incident, which took place on Wednesday at Gogte PU College of Commerce, was widely shared on social media.

The student was assaulted at a time when tensions are high in Belagavi because of the border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra.
The border dispute dates back to the period between the 1950s and 1960s when the states were formed. Maharashtra claims that 865 villages on the border should have been merged with it, while Karnataka claims 260 villages because it has the majority Kannada-speaking population.
The dispute was renewed after Karnataka Chief Minister Basavraj Bommai claimed that the Jat taluka panchayats in Sangli district had passed a resolution in November to merge with Karnataka, when there was a severe drought and acute drinking water crisis. The chief minister said that Karnataka has formulated a plan to help them.
On Thursday, Kannada Rakshana Vedike claimed that the police did not even help the student who was thrashed. The organisation alleged that the student was thrashed by the officers instead.
“It is very unbecoming of senior police officers to thrash a young boy who came to the police station to register a complaint,” said Deepak Gudaga, a member of the organisation. “We will continue to protest until the perpetrators are punished.”
He added that many colleges in Belagavi are dominated by Marathi-speaking people. He also said that Kannada culture was insulted in these colleges.
The police have now tightened security around the campus and a holiday was declared after the incident, The Indian Express reported.
Meanwhile, the college authorities have said that they will review the attack.
“The management has taken precautionary measures to respond to the emergency situation in time,” the college said in a statement. “The management consisting of the principal and other members will conduct a thorough review of the incident and appropriate action will be taken against the perpetrators responsible for the incident that took place on Wednesday.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183709-ybppiiqgka-1669896474.jpeg

Special Judge Vikas Dhull noted that fruits and vegetables were provided to Jain by the jail staff, without there being any order to do so.
He made the observation while rejecting Jain’s plea seeking a special diet for a religious fast. He had claimed that the jail authorities were not giving him food items according to his religious and medical needs.
“Providing fruits and vegetables to the applicant was in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as state is bound to treat all the prisoners equally and there can be no discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, sex, religion, status etc,” Justice Dhull said.
Jain, a minister without a portfolio in the Delhi government, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on May 30 in a money laundering case. The agency’s case is based on a disproportionate assets first information report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 2017 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. He is accused of having laundered money through four companies allegedly linked to him.
Recently, purported videos of Jain receiving foot massages and eating what appears to be packaged food in jail were widely shared on social media.
The Bharatiya Janata Party had filed a police complaint alleging that the Delhi minister was receiving special treatment behind bars.
Jain has accused the Enforcement Directorate of leaking footage from inside his jail cell to the media and had asked the court to ensure that he is given a fair trial in the case.
On Saturday, Justice Dhull noted that around 26 officials of the Tihar jail have been transferred and a jail superintendent was suspended in November, according to PTI. He added that since then Jain is purchasing fruits and vegetables from the jail canteen.
“[This] prima facie establishes on record that the incumbent Tihar Jail officials have stopped providing preferential treatment to the applicant, which was being given earlier to the applicant, in violation of the rules,” he said in his order.
On Jain’s allegation of not receiving dry fruits as part of his medical diet, the court said it was stopped by the jail’s medical officer, ANI reported.
“This court cannot substitute the advice of the doctor by its own discretion,” Justice Dhull said in the order. “The medical officer is the best person, who can advise the prescribed diet to the prisoners after observing the health of the inmates/prisoners.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/172933-kaourwksvj-1653993128.jpg

Teltumbde was among the 16 persons arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case, which pertains to caste violence in a village near Pune in 2018. He was arrested in April 2020. He has written several books and has worked as a senior professor at the Goa Institute of Management.
The Bombay High Court granted bail to Teltumbde on November 18. However, it had put a stay on the writer’s bail order for a week as the National Investigation Agency had asked for time to file an appeal in the top court.
In the bail order, the Bombay High Court bench of Justices AS Gadkari and Milind Jadhav had observed that offences under Sections 13 (unlawful activities), 16 (terrorist act) and 18 (conspiracy) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were not made out against Teltumbde.
The High Court noted that only offences under Sections 38 (membership of terrorist organisation) and 39 (support given to terrorist organisation) of the law were made out.
During Friday’s hearing at the Supreme Court, the bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justice Hima Kohli, said that the observations made by the High Court in its bail order will not be treated as conclusive final findings at the trials.
Justice Chandrachud asked the National Investigation Agency why Teltumbde had been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.
“What is the specific role to bring UAPA sections into action?” the chief justice asked. “The event you alleged is for Dalit mobilisation. Is Dalit mobilisation preparatory act to proscribed activity?”
Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing on behalf of the National Investigation Agency, told the court that letters and other forms of communication recovered from Teltumbde pointed that he had planned to create law and order problems.
“One letter says to celebrate the Naxalbari movement and how Comrade Anand gave inputs for the same and how to increase student participation,” Bhati told the court.
Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Teltumbde contended that none of the documents Bhati cited had been recovered from Teltumbde.
“The High Court says there is no document to connect Teltubmde with terrorist activity,” Sibal told the court. “He was not even at the Elgar Parishad event. They [NIA] have not shown anything.”
The National Investigation Agency has claimed that Teltumbde was among the convenors of the Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017, which allegedly sparked the violence at Bhima Koregaon on the following day.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183438-guvxocyllg-1669453424.jpg

Sixty-one senators – including 49 Democrats and 12 Republicans – voted in favour of the Bill, while 36 voted against it.
The proposed law, the Respect for Marriage Act, would require the federal government and all states to accord recognition to all same-sex marriages that were legal when they were performed, the Associated Press reported. It would not, however, make it mandatory for states to allow same-sex marriages.
The Bill was passed amid worries that the Supreme Court could overturn a 2015 decision that legalised such marriages nationwide.
“Today’s bipartisan Senate passage of the Respect for Marriage Act proves our nation is on the brink of reaffirming a fundamental truth: love is love,” United States President Joe Biden tweeted. “I look forward to the House passing this legislation and sending it to my desk, where I will proudly sign it into law.”

On June 24, the US Supreme Court had overturned the landmark 1973 Roe versus Wade ruling that had made abortion a constitutional right.
According to the 1973 verdict, abortions were allowed up till the point of foetal viability, or the time period during which a foetus can survive outside the womb. At that time, foetal viability was considered to be at 28 weeks, but experts now believe that the point could now be brought down to between 22-24 weeks given advances in science and medicine.

“During the course of investigation of the subject cited above, certain facts have emerged with which you [Kavitha] may be acquainted with,” the CBI said in its notice. “Hence, your examination on such facts is required in the interest of investigation.”
Kavitha, in a statement, said she informed the authorities that they can meet her at her home in Hyderabad.
The Enforcement Directorate on December 1 claimed that Kavitha, who is the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, was part of a “south group” which paid at least Rs 100 crore in kickbacks to leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party through businessman Vijay Nair, who has been arrested in the case.
After her name cropped up in the inquiries, Kavitha said that she was ready to face any investigation.
“If the agencies come and ask us questions, we will certainly answer,” she said. “But tarnishing leaders’ images by giving selective leaks to the media, people will refute it.”

However, on July 30, the Delhi government withdrew the policy after Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommended an inquiry into it by the central agency.
On September 1, Delhi reverted to its old liquor policy, under which only state-run stores are allowed to operate. According to the first information report, Arora was accused by the Central Bureau of Investigation of receiving a bribe of Rs 1 crore from a liquor manufacturer on behalf of Sisodia.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183798-kslzctycjr-1670045254.jpg
"CAA is discriminatory as it does not extend to Tamil refugees, DMK tells Supreme Court","Nov 30, 2022 · 04:30 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038686/caa-is-discriminatory-as-it-does-not-extend-to-tamil-refugees-dmk-tells-supreme-court,"The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a discriminatory law as it does not extend to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has told the Supreme Court, Live Law reported on Wednesday.
The party’s organising secretary RS Bharathi, in an affidavit, urged the court to declare the Act as being violative of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution.
The Act provides citizenship to refugees from six non-Muslim religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on the condition that they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014.
The DMK is among over 200 individuals and organisations that have filed petitions in the Supreme Court opposing the law. The petitioners have alleged that it promotes religion-based discrimination and violates the principle of equality before law.
The DMK said that Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka are forced to stay in camps where they often face exploitation. “The lack of jobs, access to basic rights and amenities have left these refugees handicapped and destroyed,” it said.
The party said that the law introduces religion as a completely new basis to decide on citizenship, which destroys the basic fabric of secularism, Bar and Bench reported.
According to the affidavit, the Act is arbitrary as it only relates to three countries – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh – and six religious communities – Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. “There is no reason as to why Muslims were altogether excluded even in the countries wherein they have suffered persecution,” it said.
On October 30, the Centre told the Supreme Court that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act does not affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of Indian citizens. It claimed that the Act is a “focused law” that seeks to provide a relaxation, in the nature of an amnesty, to specific communities from specified countries with a clear cut-off date.
However, the DMK leader said that the central government’s affidavit did not make any mention of the condition of Tamil refugees.
“I humbly submit that the step motherly behaviour of respondent number one [Centre] towards Tamil refugees has left them living in constant fear of deportation and an uncertain future,” Bharathi said.
The Centre has claimed that the citizenship law only seeks to provide relief to members of persecuted communities living in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
The Act is yet to be implemented as its rules have not been framed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In May, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said that the law will be enforced as soon as the pandemic ends.
However, critics fear that the Citizenship Amendment Act, clubbed with the National Register of Citizens, will be misused to target Muslims in the country.
The National Register of Citizens is meant to be a list of legal Indian citizens. It was compiled after two draft versions and excluded 19 lakh applicants when it was published in Assam in August 2019.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181001-udrmehtqlx-1665312290.jpg

The minister of state for social justice and empowerment clarified the government’s stand on the matter in response to a question by Rajya Sabha MP Anbumani Ramadoss.
The Pattali Makkal Katchi party MP had asked if the government had any proposal to relax the 50% ceiling on the reservation in view of the observations made by the Supreme Court while upholding the 10% quota to persons from Economically Weaker Sections.
On November 7, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had upheld the 10% EWS quota in a 3:2 judgement. Justices Dinesh Maheshwari, Bela Trivedi and JB Pardiwala upheld the quota, while former Chief Justice UU Lalit and Justice Rabindra Bhat dissented from the majority opinion.
In the majority judgement, Justice Maheshwari had held that the 50% ceiling in reservations was “not inflexible” and that breaching it would not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.
Citing this judgement, Ramadoss sought to know if the Centre was planning to relax the limit. He also asked if the central government had plans to increase the quota for the Other Backward Classes from the existing 27%, in proportion to the community’s population.
Union minister Bhoumik said that the Centre was not looking to introduce either of the provisions.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/110145-vwiwjcfngj-1562740614.jpg

The Rajya Sabha MP made the remark a day after members of the pro-Kannada outfit, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, allegedly threw stones at vehicles with Maharashtra registration numbers in the district. The violence took place amid tensions between Maharashtra and Karnataka in connection with a border dispute.
Raut on Wednesday said that the police in Karnataka have arrested several members of the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, an organisation that has been seeking the merger of about 800 villages in the border region with Maharashtra. “A game is afoot to break Maharashtra’s spine and to end Marathi self-respect for ever,” he claimed on Twitter. “The attacks in Belagavi are a part of the same conspiracy.”

Later, while addressing reporters, Raut demanded that the district of Belagavi should be declared as a Union Territory, PTI reported.
He also questioned why Maharashtra ministers Chandrakant Patil and Shambhuraj Desai cancelled their visit to Belagavi scheduled for Tuesday. Raut said that his party members were willing to “give them protection and march with them”.
The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader said that residents of Maharashtra were willing to go to Belagavi under the leadership of Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar.
However, the chief of the BJP’s Maharashtra unit Chandrashekhar Bawankule urged Raut not to make “baseless and provocative comments”, PTI reported. He said that the violence in Belagavi was carried out by anti-social elements, and asked how the government could be held responsible for it.
Bawankule added that the incidents of vandalism of buses from Karnataka had also been reported in Maharashtra. “Do we say the government is responsible?” he asked.
Attacks on Maharashtra residents must stop: Supriya Sule
Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule, addressing the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, called for an immediate stop to attacks on citizens from Maharashtra in Karnataka, The Indian Express reported. She pointed out that the BJP is in power in both the states.
“Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai is making ad hoc statements against Maharashtra,” Sule said. “They are conspiring to break Maharashtra. The people of Maharashtra are being beaten. They are being attacked in Karnataka.”
On Monday, Bommai had asked his Maharashtra counterpart Eknath Shinde not to send his cabinet colleagues to Belagavi. He had said that their visit could disturb law and order in the area.
Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said at a press conference on Tuesday that the Karnataka chief minister would be responsible for the consequences if attacks on vehicles from Maharashtra do not stop within 24 hours.
Pawar said that if harassment of Marathi-speaking citizens in Karnataka does not stop within 48 hours, he would have to travel to the neighbouring state to “enhance their morale”.
He said that if the Karnataka government decides to take a “provocative stand” on the matter, it would be detrimental for unity. “If this is the approach of the Karnataka government, the Centre cannot be a mute spectator,” he added.
आता जे झालं हेच उद्याच्या २४ ते ४८ तासात पूर्ण संपलं नाही तर माझ्यासह सगळ्यांना बेळगावच्या लोकांना धीर द्यायला जावे लागेल.

Border dispute
The border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra dates back to the period between the 1950s and 1960s, when the states were formed. Maharashtra claims that 865 villages on the border should have been merged with it, while Karnataka claims that the demarcation that was carried out on linguistic lines in 1956 is final.
The Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition by the Maharashtra government challenging some provisions of the State Reorganisation Act, 1956, and demanding that 865 villages in the border areas be merged with it.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/170154-popbkvqpor-1644934147.jpg

“People have made up their mind as they think that enough is enough,” the two-time legislator from the Vadgam constituency told PTI. “The Congress will win 120 out of the total 182 Assembly seats in the state polls. A change is inevitable.”
The Assembly polls in Gujarat will be held in two phases on December 1 and December 5, while the results will be declared on December 8.
The Dalit leader said that even though the ruling BJP is trying rake up emotional issues, voters will not fall for it, reported PTI.
The Congress legislator said that the BJP has failed to address issues like unemployment, price rise despite being in power for so many years.
“Now, people have witnessed that they are a repressive government as they started targeting those who raise their voice against them including Opposition leaders, advocates, journalists,” Mevani told the news agency. “They [voters] understood that this is a dictatorial government.”
In its manifesto, BJP has promised to start an anti-radicalisation cell for “anti-national” persons in Gujarat if the party is voted back to power in the upcoming Assembly elections. The party has also promised to implement the recommendation made by the judicial committee to bring in Uniform Civil Code in the state.
A Uniform Civil Code involves having a common set of laws governing marriage, divorce, succession and adoption for all Indians, instead of allowing different personal laws for people of different faiths.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183528-thorcluuxn-1669621668.jpg

Government won’t be able to violate citizens’ privacy under Data Protection Bill: Union minister,"Nov 27, 2022 · 03:41 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038440/government-wont-be-able-to-violate-citizens-privacy-under-data-protection-bill-union-minister,"The government will be able to access personal data of citizens only under exceptional circumstances under the proposed data protection law, Union Minister of State Rajeev Chandrashekhar said on Saturday, PTI reported.
The minister of state for electronics and information technology said that the government can get such data only in situations such as those pertaining to national security concerns, pandemics and natural disasters. He added that the government will not be able to violate citizens’ privacy under the Data Protection Bill.
On November 18, the Union government released a draft of the proposed law – Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022, – on its website. It has sought feedback from citizens on the draft till December 17.
The Bill puts in place regulations for all entities that deal with the personal data of citizens. It envisages the setting up of the Data Protection Board of India, which will be entrusted with ensuring compliance with the regulations and imposing penalties on violators.
While speaking about the draft Bill on Saturday, Chandrashekhar said that the right to data protection is subject to reasonable restrictions, as is the case with freedom of speech, PTI reported.
“Let us say that the government wants to essentially violate the privacy of citizens with this law,” he said. “Is it possible? That’s the question. The answer is no. The bill and laws lay out in very clear terms what are the exceptional circumstances under which the government can have access to the personal data of Indian citizens.... national security, pandemic, healthcare, natural disaster.”
The minister added that the proposed Data Protection Board will be independent and will not have any government officer. “You will not find people like me or bureaucrats sitting on the Data Protection Board,” he said. “It is important to understand that DPB is not a regulator. DPB is an adjudication mechanism to adjudicate a breach that has occurred.”

Draft law fundamentally flawed: Justice Srikrishna
However, Former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna said that the draft Bill is fundamentally flawed as it would allow the executive to “act capriciously and infringe on the fundamental right of privacy of personal data”, The Hindu reported on Friday. Srikrishna has led a committee that came with the first draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill.
The retired judge said the draft law released in November can exempt all government departments and institutions from its provisions. “That is a dangerous situation and clear invitation to the executive to act arbitrarily,” he said.
Srikrishna appeared to have been referring to Section 18(2) of the Bill. The provision states that the government can provide exemptions for the processing of data by “any instrumentality of the State in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, maintenance of public order or preventing incitement to any cognisable offence relating to any of these”.
The former Supreme Court judge said that the Data Protection Board would be “a captive of the government” under the law. “The qualifications, tenure, procedure of appointment have all been relegated to delegated legislation,” he added.
Previous version of the Bill
The Centre released the draft Bill more than three months after an earlier version of the proposed law was withdrawn.
The earlier version, the Personal Data Protection Bill, was withdrawn on August 3 after the Joint Committee of Parliament recommended 81 changes and 12 “major recommendations” to it. On September 29, the Centre told the Supreme Court that a new Bill will be introduced in the Winter Session of the Parliament.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/53301-ohvdfgmcfa-1558535061.jpg
High Court puts stay on Assam-Meghalaya border agreement,Yesterday · 10:40 am,https://scroll.in/latest/1039359/high-court-puts-stay-on-assam-meghalaya-border-agreement,"The Meghalaya High Court on Thursday put an interim stay on an agreement between the state and Assam to resolve border disputes at six of the 12 contentious locations. The stay order will stay in effect till the next date of hearing on February 23, the court said.
On March 29, the chief ministers of the two states had signed an agreement to end the disputes. Home Minister Amit Shah had described the development as historic.
The two states are embroiled in a border dispute which started when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam on January 21, 1972, under the Assam Reorganisation Act, 1971. Disputes arose at 12 locations after Meghalaya challenged the law.
Assam is the only state with which Meghalaya shares an internal border.
An area of 36.79 square kilometres was disputed between the two states. According to the agreement signed on March 29, Assam will control 18.51 square kilometres of the land and Meghalaya 18.28 square kilometres.
After signing the agreement, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma had said that both the states, along with the Survey of India, will conduct a survey, after which demarcation would take place.
The Meghalaya High Court stay order came on a petition filed by four heads of Syiemship and Sirdarship, former independent native states of the Khasi ethnic groups that function under the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, reported IANS.
The petitioners have argued that the memorandum of understanding between the Assam and Meghalaya governments was signed without consulting them. They claimed that the MoU violated provisions of the Sixth Schedule as the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council has been conferred powers on subjects such as land, water, soil, local customs and culture.
The Sixth Schedule deals with special provisions for administration of tribal areas.
At the hearing on Thursday, Advocate P Sharma, appearing for the petitioners, argued that if the demarcation is done as per the agreement signed in March, the plea to stop the exercise would become infructuous.
Advocate General A Kumar, however, urged the High Court not to pass any interim order arguing that the petitioners would not face any “irreparable loss” if the agreement is put into effect. The High Court then directed the Union government file an affidavit on the petition on the next date of hearing.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/166433-hhwtruejgj-1637058885.jpg

In its latest India Development Update report released on Tuesday, the World Bank said that India’s growth prospects were better than most other emerging markets, when it came to weathering slow global growth and higher commodity prices.
The World Bank also described India’s growth rate of 6.3% in the second quarter that ran from July to September as a “strong outturn”.
The second quarter Gross Domestic Product numbers released last week showed that India’s growth rate slowed down from 8.4% recorded in the same quarter last year. In the first quarterthat ran from April to June, the economy had grown by 13.5%.
However, the World Bank noted that despite challenges emerging in the global economy, India has remained one of the fastest growing major economies in the world due to robust domestic demand.
“India’s economy has been remarkably resilient to the deteriorating external environment, and strong macroeconomic fundamentals have placed it in good stead compared to other emerging market economies,” said Auguste Tano Kouame, World Bank’s country director for India.
The revised World Bank estimate of a 6.9% growth in this financial year is at par with the GDP growth India recorded in the previous financial year of 2021-’22.

The men – Bablu, Wasim and Munna – have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including those pertaining to gangrape, unnantural offences, assault and causing hurt by dangerous weapons, Deputy Commissioner of Police Manoj Patil said.

The theme for the awards this year was “Covering Climate Change: Humanitarian Crisis in Focus”. Both the articles were published under Scroll.in’s Common Ground project.

Chari won the third prize at this year’s awards for her article “Battered by climate change, Central India’s forest products are disappearing”. In her article published in January, Chari had detailed how climate change has led to depletion of forest produce that is crucial to millions of people and a Rs 2 lakh crore economy.
For her article, the journalist spoke to residents of six villages in eastern Maharashtra as well as cited studies and reports to highlight the impact of climate change.
Citing one of these studies by scientist Seema Yadav, Chari reported: “91% of the [village] household heads were of the opinion that number of tree species had declined over the years”, while 86% felt that the number of healthy fruit-producing trees of important forest product species had reduced.
Meanwhile, Kukreti received a special mention for his article story about the impact of climate change on dams. The article, “How climate change is making India’s big dams dangerous”, was published on March 23.
Kukreti noted that out of 5,745 dams in India, 293 were built over 100 years ago and 25% between 50 and 100 years. These old dams are not properly equipped to respond to climate change as old rainfall patterns have changed and extreme weather events have increased in frequency, he reported.
“At the root of the problem is the fact that most dams in India were built in the 1970s, and designed for the atmospheric realities of that period,” he wrote. “Now, as those realities shift dramatically with the climate crisis, the same dams that help with irrigation, drinking water and electricity generation are increasingly becoming causes of immense destruction.”

Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash. China had put the number of casualties on its side at four. Since the clash, India and China have been locked in a border standoff.
The 2022 China Military Power Report said that throughout 2021, the Chinese military sustained deployment of forces and continued building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control.
The report said the China’s actions had continued while negotiation with India to resolve the border conflict made minimal progress as both sides resisted losing perceived advantages on the border.
“Throughout the standoff, PRC [People’s Republic of China] officials sought to downplay the severity of the crisis, emphasising Beijing’s intent to preserve border stability and prevent the standoff from
harming other areas of its bilateral relationship with India,” the Pentagon said.
It added: “The PRC seeks to prevent border tensions from causing India to partner more closely with the United States. PRC officials have warned US officials to not interfere with the PRC’s relationship with India.”
The report also described the Galwan clash, in which the soldiers used rocks, batons and clubs wrapped in barbed wire at multiple locations along the Line of Actual Control, as one of the deadliest incidents between the Indian and the Chinese Army in the last 46 years.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Indian and US troops participated in a high-altitude training exercise at Uttarakhand’s Auli hill station that is situated near the disputed border area with China, reported the Associated Press.
Earlier, these exercises had taken place in other parts of northern India but this year’s drills were being held only about 100 kilometers from the Line of Actual Control.
The exercises focus on surveillance, mountain-warfare skills, casualty evacuation and combat medical aid in adverse terrain and climatic conditions, India’s Defense Ministry said.

Under the new policy, which was implemented in Delhi on November 17, licences of 849 liquor shops were issued to private firms through open bidding. However, on July 30, the Delhi government withdrew the policy after Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommended an inquiry into it by the central agency.

His wife Dominique Conchon-Lapierre told the French newspaper Var-Matin that the author died of old age. She added that he was “at peace and serene since Dominique is no longer suffering”.
In 1975, Lapierre co-authored Freedom at Midnight with American writer Larry Collins – an account of the last days of British rule in India, the initial few months of the country’s independence and the death of Mahatma Gandhi.
Born on July 30, 1931, Lapierre’s most popular work Is Paris Burning? was also co-authored with Collins and was published in 1965. The book traced the events of the Second World War leading up to the period in 1944 when Nazi forces of Germany seized control of Paris.
In his novel City of Joy, published in 1985, Lapierre wrote about the hardships of a rickshaw puller in Kolkata. Lapierre also co-authored Five Past Midnight in Bhopal, a witness account of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy.
Lapierre was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian award, in 2008.
Several social media users on Monday paid their tributes to the author and reflected on his works.
The man who had coined the now iconic term 'City of Joy' which is now synonymous with Calcutta, passes away. Author Dominique Lapierre dies at the age of 91. This Frenchmans book on Kolkata, its rickshaw puller to be precise, made him a household name in Bengal.

Attorney General R Venkataramani said that the documents will be produced in a sealed cover.
A Constitution Bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna, V Ramasubramanian and BV Nagarathna that heard 58 petitions challenging the 2016 decision reserved its verdict. The bench allowed parties to submit written submissions by December 10.
On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease to be legal tender in India from midnight. Modi had said that the decision had been taken to “fight corruption, black money and terrorism”.
The Rs 2,000 notes and Rs 500 notes with a new design were introduced after demonetisation.
Several persons, many of them elderly, had died while standing in long queues to exchange their money. As millions of families were left stranded with no cash, many even killed themselves after failing to exchange old notes for valid currency.
The petitioners have claimed that the exercise violated several constitutional rights of citizens, such as the right to property (Article 300A), right to equality (Article 14), right to carry on any trade, business or occupation (Article 19) and right to life and right to livelihood (Article 21).
During the hearings, the Supreme Court had said that it will not play the role of a silent spectator only because it was an economic policy decision.
The Central government had defended the exercise, telling the Supreme Court on November 16 that demonetisation was a “well-considered decision” taken after advance preparation and consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.
The government had said there were several benefits of the demonetisation exercise such as reduction of fake currency notes, an increase in digital transactions and the detection of unaccounted income.
On Monday, Advocate General R Venkataramani had said that the hardships faced by the public due to demonetisation cannot be considered a fault of the 2016 decision.
Venkataramani had said that it was not appropriate to consider only hardships faced by the public when the the government was addressing problems such as fake currency, black money and terror funding.
A day later, the Reserve Bank of India also backed the demonetisation exercise, reported The Hindu.

Modi cast his vote at a polling station in Ahmedabad in the morning. The second phase of the election was held today in 93 constituencies.
Visuals by ANI showed Modi waving to citizens as he walked to the polling booth.

Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that the prime minister held a roadshow for two-and-a-half hours, thus violating the election guidelines.
“You [media] have your compulsions, so you show it live,” Khera remarked at a press conference. “But what is the compulsion of the Election Commission that it sees it live, and yet remains silent?”
The Congress spokesperson said that the party has been making representations to the poll panel about alleged violations of the model code of conduct every two or three days, but it has not taken any action.
Khera said that visuals aired by media channels of Modi’s visit to the polling station constituted free publicity for the BJP for three hours.

The chief of the BJP’s Gujarat unit CR Paatil claimed that no roadshow took place in Ahmedabad on Monday, and asserted that Modi respects the Election Commission’s regulations. “He did not go to the polling station in his own car despite security considerations,” he said. “Even in the midst of such tight security, he preferred not to sit in his car.”
Patil said that Modi did not speak to anyone after casting his vote, and did not address the media.

"Scrapping of NJAC by SC a glaring disregard of people’s mandate, says Jagdeep Dhankhar","Dec 08, 2022 · 09:03 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1039278/scrapping-of-njac-by-sc-a-glaring-disregard-of-peoples-mandate-says-jagdeep-dhankhar,"Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday reiterated his criticism of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015, reported Live Law.
The Supreme Court’s judgement was “a glaring instance of severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people of which the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha are custodians”, Dhankhar said on his first day as the chairperson of the Upper House on the opening day of the Winter Session of Parliament.
The comments came amid a renewed rift between the Union government and the Supreme Court over the appointment of judges. Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju had told news channel Times Now on November 26 that the collegium system is not in consonance with the Constitution. Two days later, the Supreme Court had objected to the statement.
Justice SK Kaul also questioned whether the government was not clearing names for judicial appointments as the Supreme Court had struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act.
The law had proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
The National Judicial Appointments Commission was to replace the collegium system, under which five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, decide on the appointments and transfers of judges to the top court and the High Courts.

Why are the Supreme Court and Modi government in a war of words over judicial appointments?
In his address on Wednesday, the vice president said that democracy “blossoms and flourishes” when the legislature, the judiciary and the executive adhere to their domains. “Any incursion by one, howsoever subtle, in the domain of other, has the potential to upset the governance apple cart,” Dhankhar added, according to the Hindustan Times.
Noting that the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill was passed unanimously in both Houses (with one abstention in the Lok Sabha), he said that there has rarely been such an overwhelming support for a Constitutional legislation in Parliamentary history.
However, the vice president said this “historic parliamentary mandate” was undone by the Supreme Court that found the law was not in consonance with basic structure of the Constitution. The basic structure doctrine states that the Constitution of a sovereign country has certain characteristics that cannot be erased by its legislature.
The vice president added that there is no parallel to such a development in democratic history where a “duly legitimised Constitutional prescription has been judicially undone”.

Dhankhar had expressed similar views on December 2 about the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act.
“We the people – their ordainment was converted into a constitutional provision,” he had said at the LM Singhvi Memorial Lecture. “Power of the people, which was expressed through a legitimate platform, that power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance.”
He had also said that when a substantive question of law is made, courts can look into the problem. But he added, citing the Constitution, that “nowhere it says a provision can be run down”.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184035-ljufbuzoar-1670467568.jpeg

Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai provided the information in a written reply to questions put forth by Congress Rajya Sabha MPs Digvijaya Singh and Amee Yajnik. They had asked the government for statewise details about the number of NGOs whose Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, or FCRA, certificates had not been renewed or were suspended in the last five years.
Registration under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act is mandatory to receive foreign funds. Legal amendments made in 2020 to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act allow the government to extend tighter control over the utilisation of foreign funds by organisations.
In Wednesday’s answer, Rai said that the NGOs will not be eligible for registration or grant of prior permission for three years from the date of cancellation of their registration.
He also said that the most number of licences were cancelled in Tamil Nadu (755), followed by Maharashtra (734), Uttar Pradesh (635), Andhra Pradesh (622) and West Bengal (611).
In another question, regarding the cancellation of the foreign funding licence of two NGOs headed by former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Rai said they were found to have been violating the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act.
In October, the Centre had suspended the licence of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Both organisations have top leaders of the Congress party, including Rahul Gandhi, as members.
The FCRA licence was cancelled under section 14 (not being engaged in any reasonable activity in its chosen field for the benefit of the society for two consecutive years or has become defunct), for violation of provisions under section 11 (no person having a definite cultural, economic, educational, religious or social programme shall accept foreign contribution unless such person obtains a certificate of registration from the central government) and section 12(4)(a)(vi) (not to use foreign contribution for personal gains and divert it for undesirable purposes) of the Act, Rai said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/169896-hwyyzkqwix-1644405765.jpg

On November 25, the professor had asked the student his name, and on hearing the name, he remarked: “Oh you are like Kasab”. The professor was apparently referring to Ajmal Kasab, who was convicted and hanged to death for his involvement in the terrorist attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008.
After a video of the student objecting to the remark was shared widely on social media, the institute debarred the professor from taking classes and set up an inquiry committee into the matter.
Commenting on the matter, Nagesh claimed on Tuesday: “The teacher shouldn’t have said that but it’s just politics and confirming the vote bank.”
He added, “Almost everyone everyday uses words like Ravan, Shakuni. Even in Assembly many times, we’ve spoken like this. It doesn’t become an issue. When you speak about Kasab it becomes an issue.”
Incidentally, Nagesh made the remark on a day when the Bharatiya Janata Party objected to a remark by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Raavan.
Kharge made the statement at a poll rally in Gujarat.
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the remark was not just an insult to the prime minister, but to every resident of Gujarat.
Meanwhile, the student at the Manipal Institute of Technology said that he spoke to the professor and “realised that he genuinely meant that apology” and urged the student community to let it go as a genuine mistake, NDTV reported.
“I understand what was going on in his head and would like to believe he didn’t mean it,” he said in a message circulated on WhatsApp. “It came across wrong from a teacher, a person we admire, but it can be ignored this time. Thank you for standing with me through this. It means a lot.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/179011-yrynpbfdct-1661596711.jpg

The blast took place at 11.22 pm on Friday at the Sarhali police station located on the Amritsar-Bathinda highway. The grenade hit Saanjh Kendra, which provides services such as copies of first information reports and passport verification.
There were no casualties in the incident, the police said. However, the window panes of Saanjh Kendra suffered damage.
Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav said that as per a preliminary investigation, military-grade hardware may have been used to fire the grenade, ANI reported. The case could be one of cross-border smuggling, he said.
“There is a clear indication that it is a strategy of the neighbouring nation to bleed India by a thousand cuts,” Yadav said.
The police have filed a first information report under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. An Army team has also reached the spot to look into the incident.
“We will investigate this technically and forensically, all clues from the scene of the crime are being collected so that we reconstruct what happened,” the state police chief said. “We are recovering the launcher.”
Yadav added that there appeared to be several similarities between the blast on Friday and the grenade attack on the state Police Intelligence Wing headquarters in Mohali on May 9.
Aam Aadmi Party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal said that strict action will be taken in the case, according to ANI.
“Since AAP came to power, big gangsters nabbed in Punjab,” he said. “People who were acting under the protection of old parties were caught.”

Assistant Sessions Judge Arul Varma passed the directions while hearing arguments on the framing of charges in a case filed by the police under provisions pertaining to rioting, attempt to commit culpable homicide and criminal conspiracy.
The police have booked student activists Sharjeel Imam, Safoora Zargar, Mohammed Ilyas, Belaal Nadeem, Shahzar Raza Khan, Mahmood Anwar, Mohammed Qasim, Umair Ahmad, Chanda Yadav and Abuzar in the case.
On December 15, 2019, violence had erupted on the Jamia Millia Islamia campus during the student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Delhi Police was accused of barging into the university campus and using excessive force to quell the demonstrations. The police claimed its action was justified as the protestors had allegedly injured its personnel and set buses on fire.
The court, in its order on Saturday, noted that Special Public Prosecutor Madhukar Pandey was appearing in the case for the first time. The court said that he sought an adjournment as the case file had been given to him recently and he needed time to prepare his arguments.
Judge Verma said that the special public prosecutor was appointed on July 26, 2021, but neither the investigating officer nor the assistant commissioner of police or the deputy commissioner of police brought the case to his notice.
“Let copy of this order be sent to concerned DCP Crime Branch to give explanation as to why the file was not brought to the notice of [the special public prosecutor] despite him being appointed as per above mentioned notification,” the court said, according to Live Law. “Report be filed on the next date of hearing.”

“All hospital services, including outpatient, in-patient, laboratories, etc continue to run on manual mode,” it added.
Due to the cyber attack on November 23, several patient care services at the institute had been disrupted. The National Informatics Centre had said that the incident was a ransomware attack, in which hackers demand money to restore access to online services.
The police, however, said on Monday that AIIMS authorities had not got any ransomware demand, reported The Times of India. The police had registered a case of extortion and cyber terrorism on November 25.

“A day before Bommai talked about including villages from Sangli district in his state,” the Nationalist Congress Party leader, said. “Today he is saying the same about villages from Solapur district. The Centre should intervene and stop the Karnataka chief minister from making such statements.”
On Tuesday, Bommai had claimed that the Jat taluka panchayats in Sangli district had passed a resolution to merge with Karnataka when there was a severe drought and acute drinking water crisis. The chief minister said that Karnataka has formulated a plan to help them.
On Thursday, Pawar alleged that Bommai was making such statements to divert the attention of Karnataka residents from inflation and unemployment in his state.
“The border dispute case between Maharashtra and Karnataka is still pending before the Supreme Court,” he said. “Despite that, he is making unprovoked statements.”
The Supreme Court will hear the case next month, according to the Hindustan Times.
Bommai’s statement also drew sharp reactions from his BJP colleague and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who said that not a single village would go to Karnataka.
Fadnavis also clarified that the no resolution has been passed by the panchayats recently. The resolution Bommai referred to had been passed in 2012, he said. The deputy chief minister also said that the previous Maharashtra government under his leadership had entered into an agreement with Karnataka to sort out the dispute, reported NDTV.
He said that a water supply scheme has been undertaken to tackle the problem of the villages.
“We are now going to approve that scheme,” he added. “Perhaps because of Covid-19, the previous [Uddhav Thackeray-led] government could not approve it.”
In response, Bommai said that Fadnavis was making a provocative statement on the dispute and that his “dream will never come true”. “Our government is committed to protecting the country’s land, water and borders,” the chief minister said.
The border dispute dates back to the period between 1950s and 1960s when the states were formed. Maharashtra claims that 865 villages on the border should have been merged with it, while Karnataka claims 260 villages on the grounds that it has majority Kannada-speaking population, according to the Hindustan Times.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/137616-nuxsoryskg-1669296424.jpg

Kanti Kharadi, who is seeking re-election from the Danta constituency in Banaskantha district, claimed that he escaped from his attackers and hid in the forest.
“I was attacked by the BJP candidate Ladhu Parghi and 150 of his goons with swords around 9.30 pm,” Kharadi told NDTV. “They would have killed me, so I ran and hid in a jungle for three-four hours. The police found me after.”
Kharadi alleged that he was going to his constituency along with his supporters when Parghi and others blocked his car and surrounded him.
“They blocked us, then we turned the car, and another car blocked us from the other side,” the Congress MLA said. “Then we left the car and ran. We thought we must escape, we ran for 10-15 km.”

The Gujarat Police, however, said they are investigating the matter.
“A team has been sent to the site of the alleged incident and investigations are on to ascertain if it was an accident or something else,” an unidentified police officer told The Indian Express.

Persons accused of rape shouldn’t be discharged due to absence of allegation at FIR stage: Delhi HC,"Nov 25, 2022 · 10:56 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038298/persons-accused-of-rape-shouldnt-be-discharged-due-to-absence-of-allegation-at-fir-stage-delhi-hc,"The Delhi High Court has said that an accused person should not be discharged from a rape case merely because the woman had not made the allegation when the first information report was filed, PTI reported on Thursday.
The court passed the order in response to a revision petition filed by the police against a trial court order from 2016 discharging a group of men from the offence of rape. The trial court had, however, charged them under provisions of the Indian Penal Code pertaining to voluntarily causing hurt, molestation, assault or criminal force against women with intent to disrobe her, house trespass, words or gestures intended to outrage a woman’s modesty and common intent.
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma of the High Court on Wednesday held that the woman’s statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure disclosing the offence of rape is enough to frame charges for the offence, Live Law reported. The provision deals with statements made before a magistrate in a criminal case.
The judge said that courts must give careful consideration to the aftermath of an incident of sexual violence against a person. “There is no doubt about the trauma which a victim has to face, both physically and emotionally, after incidents of such a nature,” the court said. “Many a times, a person may not be in an emotional or physical state to take an immediate stand against the assailant or to go through further trauma of investigation by the police or through an intrusive medical examination.”
Justice Sharma said that there could be instances where a medico-legal examination cannot disclose the crime. She said that trial courts should not venture into detailed assessments of evidence when charges are being framed.
“One such example is when it has been alleged that an act of rape has been committed by a finger or by any other object or in any manner where restraint marks or other medical evidence could not be adduced,” the High Court said.
Justice Sharma said that trial courts are “bound to frame charges” when there is prima facie material on record that a crime has been committed. The High Court charged the accused persons with the offence of rape, in addition to the other charges against them.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/179776-qbzlpaxual-1662967185.jpg

The private member’s Bill introduced by the Bharatiya Janata Party MP Kirodi Lal Meena seeks to set up the national inspection and investigation committee for a nationwide implementation of the Uniform Civil Code throughout the country.
A Uniform Civil Code entails a common law that will govern marriages, divorces, adoption and succession for all Indians. At present, these practices are regulated by the personal law of the individual’s religion. The aim of a Uniform Civil Code is meant to ensure equality and justice for women in particular, who are often denied their rights in marriage, divorce and inheritance under patriarchal personal laws.
Opposition members in the Upper House on Friday said that the Bill will destroy the social fabric and unity in diversity that is prevalent in the country. The Rajya Sabha members from Trinamool Congress, Communist Party of India, and Congress have demanded that the Bill be withdrawn.
Union minister Piyush Goyal said that the Opposition should not criticise the Bill at the introduction stage and let it be introduced, The Hindu reported.
“I am pained to see the comments made by members quoting Ambedkar,” Goyal said. “It is the legitimate right of a member to raise an issue which is under the directive principles of the constitution, let this subject be debated in the House.”
Rajya Sabha Chairperson Jagdeep Dhankhar called for division and the motion for the introduction of the Bill was passed with 63 votes in favour and 23 against it.
However, several Opposition members were absent during the discussion and at the time of voting, reported The Hindu.
“You may have the majority, they are implementing the agenda of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh,” Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam founder Vaiko said during the session. “They have finished Kashmir...we are leading towards disaster and disintegration of the country, minorities are terribly hurt, kindly see that the Bill is not introduced today. It is a day of shame and sorrow that we have to go through this.”
The BJP has been advocating for the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code and has even promised to do so in states where it is in power. In the recently concluded Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections, the party had promised to set up a committee to bring in Uniform Civil Code if it was voted back to power.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184122-qhkafzuonc-1670593110.jpg

“We have allowed all vehicles to enter into Meghalaya,” Guwahati Deputy Commissioner of Police Sudhakar Singh said.
An unidentified police official told PTI that wherever necessary, vehicles were being escorted. “In other vulnerable areas, police patrolling has been provided,” he said.
On Tuesday, five residents of Meghalaya and an official of the Assam Forest Guard were killed as the Assam Police opened fire after an altercation. The two states give conflicting versions of the incident, including where it took place.
According to Assam, it happened in West Karbi Anglong district’s “Mukhrow” village. Meghalaya claims the same place as “Mukroh” village, part of its West Jaintia Hills district.
After the deaths, the Assam Police had on Tuesday issued an advisory asking residents of the state to avoid travelling to Meghalaya on account of incidents of violence in the state.
Territorial disputes between the two states had begun when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam on January 21, 1972, under the Assam Reorganisation Act, 1971. Disputes arose after Meghalaya had challenged the law.
Protestors burn effigies of Amit Shah, Conrad Sangma
Meanwhile, members of several social organisations in Shillong on Saturday burnt effigies of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma, state Home Minister Lahkmen Rymbui and others to protest against the deaths, PTI reported.
The groups initially planned to burn the effigies at the entrance of the chief minister’s bungalow in Shillong, but were shifted to a nearby area by the police.
The protest was organised by the Save Hynniewtrep Mission, which comprises Hynniewtrep Youth Council, East Jaintia National Council, Jaintia Students Movement, Hynniewtrep Achik National Movement and Confederation of Ri Bhoi People, according to India Today.

On Saturday, Hynniewtrep Youth Council General Secretary Roy Kupar Synrem said that the firing incident was a result of the apathy of the Central, Assam and Meghalaya governments to resolve the inter-state border dispute.
“Mukroh firing incident happened due to the lack of seriousness on the part of the three governments to resolve the border dispute,” Synrem said, according to NorthEast Now.

Iran protestors call for 3-day strike amid conflicting reports about morality police,"Dec 05, 2022 · 11:42 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1039042/iran-protestors-call-for-3-day-strike-amid-conflicting-reports-about-morality-police,"Protesters in Iran on Sunday called for a three-day strike amid conflicting reports that the morality police had been abolished, reported Reuters.
Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri had made the statement about the morality police being disbanded. However, the interior ministry, which is in charge of the morality police, has not confirmed the development.
The morality police has been held responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been taken into custody for allegedly violating the mandatory rule for women to wear a hijab. While the officials claim she died of heart attack on September 16, critics and protestors believe she was physically assaulted on accusations of violating the hijab mandate.
Her death has sparked a violent protests across the country.

Following the attorney general’s statement, there have been fewer sightings of the morality police on the streets, Reuters reported, citing social media posts and local newspapers such as Shargh.
The protestors have also called for a rally in Tehran’s Azadi Square on Wednesday, reported The Guardian. Similar calls for strikes and mass mobilisation have in past weeks led to an escalation in the protest.
According to Iran-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 470 protestors, including 64 minors, have been killed as of Saturday. The agency has put the number of arrests at 18,210 and deaths of security personnel at 61. However, the interior ministry claims the toll is 200.

Supreme Court objects to Kiren Rijiju’s remarks about collegium system,"Nov 28, 2022 · 04:34 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038512/supreme-court-objects-to-kiren-rijijus-remarks-about-collegium-system,"The Supreme Court on Monday objected to remarks made by Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju about the collegium system of appointing judges to the higher judiciary, Bar and Bench reported.
A bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and AS Oka also asked why the government was not clearing names recommended by the collegium for judicial appointments.
“Mr Attorney General, I have ignored all press reports, but this has come from somebody high enough also with an interview... I am not saying anything else,” Justice Kaul told Attorney General R Venkataramani. “If we have to, we will take a decision.”
The court said that the government should not force it to “take a judicial decision in this regard”.
While the court did not take specific names, it appeared to have been referring to Rijiju’s remarks while speaking to news channel Times Now on November 26.
The law minister had said that the collegium system is not in consonance with the Constitution. “You tell me under which provision the collegium system has been prescribed,” he had said. Rijiju added that the collegium cannot expect the government to simply accept all the recommendations it makes.
On Monday, the Supreme Court was hearing a contempt petition filed last year by the Advocates Association Bengaluru against the Union law ministry for not approving 11 names given by the Supreme Court collegium.
Justice Kaul questioned whether the government was not clearing names for judicial appointments as the Supreme Court had struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015, Live Law reported.
The law had proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
The National Judicial Appointments Commission was to replace the collegium system, under which five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, decide on the appointments and transfers of judges to the top court and the High Courts.
The Supreme Court on Monday said that withholding of names for judicial appointments frustrates the entire system.
“When we persuade youngsters to accept judgeship, their concern is what is the guarantee the appointments take place in time,” Justice Kaul said. “…Timelines have to be adhered to. Many recommendations have crossed the four month limit.”
The attorney general told the court that he would try and resolve the matter. The case will be heard on December 8.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183539-ghhbzvgndv-1669633432.jpg

The protestors attacked the Vizhingam police station on Sunday, officials said.
Fishermen, under the aegis of the Latin Catholic diocese of Thiruvananthapuram, have been protesting against the Rs 7,500-crore project for the last few months. They allege that its construction could cause massive sea erosion and lead to a loss of their dwellings and livelihoods, The Indian Express reported.
The protest took a violent turn on Saturday after demonstrators prevented the Adani Group from resuming construction at the project site, which has been suspended for the last four months. The construction at the port was resumed on the directions of the Kerala High Court.
A clash also took place between the protestors and local Hindu organisations, who came out in support of the port project, according to The Indian Express.
On Sunday, a first information report was registered against Thiruvananthapuram Archbishop Thomas Netto, Auxiliary Bishop R Kristudas and 13 other Latin Catholic priests in connection with Saturday’s violence, according to PTI.
The fishermen community also alleged that the police took five men in custody.
“The police took into custody a person who was not involved in Saturday’s attack,” Vizhinjam action council convener Eugene Pereira told The Indian Express. “Later, when four others went to the station to enquire about the custody of a fisherman, they were also detained at the station.”
On Sunday night, the protestors attacked the Vizhinjam police station, demanding the release of those arrested. According to the police, the protestors held officials hostage, vandalised furniture and damaged several vehicles parked on the police station premises.
On Monday, Additional Director General of Police MR Ajith Kumar said that 36 police personnel were injured in the attack at the station.
“They vandalised the police station and attacked the officers,” Kumar said, according to PTI. “An SI [Sub-Inspector] has received an open fracture on his leg. It seems like he was hit by a brick.”
Kerala Port Development Minister Ahamed Devarkovil said that he has directed the district collector to convene an all-party meeting to ensure peace in the area.
“The issue is coming up before the high court on Monday,” Devarkovil said, according to The Indian Express. “The government would also consider the outcome from the high court before deciding further action. The agitators had given an assurance at the high court that they would not obstruct the construction. Now, that assurance to the court has been breached.”
Meanwhile, the police also said they have released on bail four out of the five men held in custody. One person has been sent to judicial custody.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183529-psytqmriyt-1669622426.jpg

Justice Navin Chawla passed the interim order on a plea filed by the actor seeking protection of his publicity rights against the Kaun Banega Crorepati lottery scam and other online frauds where his photo and voice are being misused to deceive the public.
“I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie case in his favour,” Chawla said. “The balance of convenience also lies in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants.”
Senior Advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Bachchan, began his arguments by showing the High Court details about a lottery by the name of All India sim card WhatsApp lucky draw, reported Bar and Bench.
“Lucky draw holder name – Amitabh Bachchan and Mukesh Ambani,” he told the High Court, adding that complaints have been filed that the lottery advertisement was a scam.
After citing another example of online fraud that uses Bachchan’s name, Salve said: “I am just giving a flavour of what is going on. Someone is making t-shirts and started putting his face on them. Someone is selling his poster. Someone has gone and registered a domain name, amitabhbachchan.com. This is why we have come.”
In his suit, Bachchan has sought a John Doe order, or a ruling against unknown infringers, that are violating his publicity rights. He also sought an interim injunction stopping four of the defendants from transferring, alienating or creating any third party rights in respect to domain names amitabhbachchan.com and amitabhbachchan.in.
The High Court observed that the defendants seem to be using Bachchan’s celebrity status without his permission and their activities was bringing disrepute to the actor.
It also directed the Department of Telecommunications and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to pull down the links provided by Bachchan and the telecom service providers to block access to all phone numbers used by the defendants to circulate messages that infringes the actor’s rights.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183403-xocycbagig-1669370174.jpg

“We have always supported the Palestinian people in their pursuit of economic and social development with dignity and self-reliance,” Modi said. “We are hopeful that direct talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides will resume to find a comprehensive and negotiated solution.”
He made the statement on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people designated by the United Nations on November 29. The day focuses on the question of Palestine which remains unresolved and that the Palestinian people have yet to attain their inalienable rights as defined by the General Assembly, according to the UN.
Israel and Palestine are embroiled in a long-standing conflict since 1967 when Tel Aviv annexed West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Israel sees all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern section of the city as the capital of its future state.
Palestine also seek independence, sovereignty and the right to return to their homes and property, from which they have been displaced by the Israeli forces, according to the UN.
In his message on Tuesday, Modi said that India has extended developmental assistance to Palestine over the years with projects such as India-Palestine Techno Park, Palestine National Printing Press and four schools that are already functional.
India is also providing assistance for development of Palestine Diplomatic Academy, women empowerment centre and a super specialty hospital, the prime minister said.
India’s diplomatic stance has been of supporting the Palestinian cause. Last year at a United Nations Security Council session, India had reaffirmed its support for establishing an independent and democratic Palestinian state .

On October 14, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court had acquitted the former Delhi University professor who was sentenced to life in 2017. A bench of Justices Rohit Deo and Anil Pansare had held that a sessions court in Gadchiroli charged Saibaba under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act without sanctions from the Centre.
However, just a day later, the Supreme Court suspended the High Court order while hearing a petition filed by the Maharashtra government challenging Saibaba’s acquittal. In its order, a bench of Justices MR Shah and Bela M Trivedi held that the High Court did not consider Saibaba’s appeal on its merits, and gave its judgement only on technical grounds.

He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hurt by a tweet, but not the deaths of innocent citizens due to the bridge collapse in the Gujarat’s Morbi district on October 30.
The Trinamool Congress spokesperson was first held in Jaipur on December 5 by the Gujarat Police. He was formally arrested after being brought to Ahmedabad, and subsequently sent to police custody till December 8. The Gujarat Police had alleged that Gokhale tweeted fake news about Modi’s visit to Morbi to get political mileage.
On Thursday, a court in Ahmedabad granted bail to the spokesperson, but he was soon re-arrested in another case filed in the Morbi district. A court in Morbi granted him bail again on Friday.
Gokhale on Saturday questioned why the owners of the Oreva Group, which renovated the suspension bridge in Morbi, had not been named in a first information report or arrested. “Modi is hurt by a tweet,” he remarked. “Not by deaths of 135 innocent people.”
The colonial-era bridge on the Machchu river in Morbi had collapsed just four days after it was reopened for the public following seven months of renovation. The tragedy claimed 141 lives.
Ironically I was arrested twice in 3 days for a tweet about Morbi bridge collapse.

And till date, the owners of Oreva company who built the faulty bridge haven’t even been named in an FIR let alone arrested.

Modi is hurt by a tweet. Not by deaths of 135 innocent people.

The TMC spokesperson said that he was not given any notice for five days after the first case against him was registered in Ahmedabad. “The police told me that the IB was tracking me and told CISF to intercept me at Jaipur airport,” he claimed. “Ahmedabad Police who were in Delhi for a different case were told to rush to Jaipur to arrest me.”
Gokhale claimed that the cases against him were filed to target him and keep him in jail. “A frivolous case was filed for sharing a tweet made by someone else,” he said. “Funnily the police have no clue who that person is.”
On December 1, Gokhale had shared a news clipping about a purported Right to Information application which claimed that Modi’s visit to Morbi cost Rs 30 crore. However, on the same day, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a fact check saying that the information was fake.
The news clipping appeared to be from the local newspaper Gujarat Samachar. The newspaper later denied having published the news, according to the police.
Meanwhile, the TMC spokesperson said that the second case against him was filed against him “on behalf of BJP’s ally Election Commission”. The first information report was filed on the basis of a complaint by DA Zala, the election officer of the Morbi Assembly constituency, according to the Deccan Herald.
“Surprisingly, the case for ‘electoral interference’ was filed after polling for both phases [of the Gujarat election] was over,” Gokhale tweeted. “EC, however, is ok with communal speeches & roadshows by Modi on poll day.”

A group of fisherfolk, under the aegis of the Latin Catholic diocese of Thiruvananthapuram, had been protesting against the Rs 7,500-crore project led by billionaire Gautam Adani’s ports business. They have alleged that the project will cause coastal erosion and damage their livelihoods.
The protest took a violent turn on November 26 after demonstrators prevented the Adani Group from resuming construction at the project site, where work had been suspended for the past four months. The construction at the port was resumed on the directions of the Kerala High Court.

The Bengaluru Police on November 21 had cited the High Court order while denying permission to the Namma Pride March for the LGBTQIA+ community, which took place on Sunday, The Times of India reported. The event was nonetheless attended by more than 2,000 participants.
An application against the ban was filed by the Coalition For Sex Workers and Sexuality Minority Rights, which holds the Pride March in Bengaluru, Live Law reported.
Senior advocate Aditya Sondhi, appearing for the applicant, said that the organisers of the pride march were not a party to the suo motu public interest litigation in which the court stated that protests, marches and dharnas could only take place at Freedom Park.
“For the last 14 years this walk has been taking place peacefully without any law and order issues,” he said. “The idea is for the community to take a step away from the daily experience of ostracism and rejection and show the world that there is nothing wrong with being LGBTQIA+. In fact, it is an identity which can and should be asserted with pride.”
He added that pride marches allow the public to interact with the members of the LGBTQIA+ community.
“To be confined to one space without being allowed to be seen by the public and to build public awareness about the community, defeats the essential purpose of the pride programme itself,” he said.
After hearing the arguments, Justices Alok Aradhe and S Vishwajit said that the words “protests, marches and dharnas” in its order from August will be substituted with “protests, protest marches and dharnas”.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183696-pcxynijuoy-1669885175.jpg

The police made the submission on a plea filed by Khalid seeking interim bail for two weeks to attend his sister’s wedding. The plea will now be heard next week.
The activist has been booked under an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case pertaining to clashes that had broken out between February 23 and February 26, 2020, among supporters of the Citizenship Amendment Act and those opposing it in North East Delhi. The violence had left 53 dead and hundreds injured. Most of those killed were Muslims.
The Delhi Police claim the violence was part of a larger conspiracy to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and was hatched by those who organised the protests, including Khalid, against the amended Citizenship Act.
On Friday, the Delhi Police said they have confirmed about the marriage from Khalid’s parents and the manager of the wedding venue. However, they opposed the interim plea on the grounds that the activist, who was arrested on September 13, 2020, is facing serious charges, including those under the UAPA.
The police also claimed that Khalid may influence witnesses in the case if released.
“His regular bail application has been dismissed by this court and the appeal by the division bench of the High Court,” the police said. “Further, his parents are capable of making all necessary arrangements.”
On October 18, the Delhi High Court had denied bail to Khalid saying that the allegations against him were prima facie true and so Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act prevents granting him bail.
The High Court had said that demonstrations planned by Khalid and other activists against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens were “not a typical protest” but were far more destructive.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/140376-hrwiekmxit-1669380875.jpg
AIIMS is struggling to restore services after hackers cripple its computer systems,"Nov 30, 2022 · 08:07 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038702/how-aiims-is-working-to-restore-services-after-hackers-crippled-its-computer-systems,"Seven days after the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi was crippled by a cyberattack that disabled its computer systems and forced the administration to process patients’ records manually, only some of the data had been restored by Wednesday, said a hospital spokesperson.
The corrupted servers stored the health profiles and treatment records of 2 crore-4 crore patients, officials said. Among them are the records of politicians who have been treated at AIIMS.
The spokesperson said that the hospital by Wednesday was able to restore e-Hospital data relating to online appointment booking, access to lab reports and blood availability status. However, the facility continues to manually operate out-patient and in-patient services, as well as its tts laboratory report activities.
The AIIMS out-patient department usually sees 12,000 patients a day. It has been functioning much slower than usual since digital files can no longer be filled or accessed.
“The network is being sanitised before the services can be restored,” the spokesperson said. “The process is taking some time due to the volume of data and the large number of servers/computers for the hospital service.”
AIIMS server down for 8 days, two suspended, more on radar for cyber security breach, say Sources

The last major attack on a public health system occured in 2017, when hackers disrupted services to 80 hospitals of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service for over a week. The attack cost the UK government 92 million pounds to fix.
Officials at AIIMS refused to confirm if they had been hit by a ransomware attack, which involved the hackers demanding a payment to restore the data. But officials did not rule out the possibility. “The team noted that the infected files had changed extensions [extension names], indicating possible ransomware attack,” a hospital spokesperson said.
Rahul Sasi, co-founder and CEO of CloudSEK, a company protects entities from digital risks, said that in a ransomware attack, “the cyber criminal hacks the system, deletes data and asks for ransom in exchange of restoring data. In a normal cyber attack, a hacker only tries to showcase his skills or to point to a security lapse in the system.”
The Delhi Police have registered a case under Section 385 of the Indian Penal Code, which relates with extortion, in addition to section 66F of Information Technology Act, which relates with cyber terrorism.
The National Investigation Agency also sent a team to AIIMS on November 25 to investigate the cyberattack.
The attack
According to AIIMS director M Srinivas, the first hint of a cyber attack came at 6.45 am on November 23 when the emergency laboratory department complained it could not view reports in the National Informatics Centre’s laboratory information system. Soon the billing counter and out-patient department faced similar problems.
The National Informatics Centre found that files on the main server had been corrupted. This server stores the AIIMS e-Hospital database and another two servers that store the laboratory information system’s database and applications. The e-Hospital database contains information on billing, appointments, prescriptions and consultations. It acts as a facilitator between departments, providing information on a patient’s diagnostic reports online. This eliminates the need to physically move files from one place to another.
The database containing patients’ Unique Health Identification records was also compromised. The Unique Health Identification programme was launched in September 2021 by the government to create digital health records of all patients who visit both public and private hospitals.
Two other servers that had a secondary database of the e-Hospital and laboratory information systems were not corrupted and were immediately detached from the network. AIIMS began to back up this data on November 23. It also made provisions for a server to store the data recovered from the backup. The infected system was removed and sent for forensic analysis.
AIIMS officials said they called in the Computer Emergency Response Team (known as CERT-IN), the government’s agency that investigates computer security threats.
Hospital forced to operate manually
Due to the digital shutdown, the already crowded hospital took even longer to attend to its patients. The hospital had to draw on its researchers and doctors to help handle services as forms had to be filled out manually.
In 2020-’21, AIIMS admitted 1.40 lakh patients and operated on 72,737 patients, the hospital’s annual report says. More than 15.4 lakh patients visited its out-patient department that year.
With the shutdown of the servers, doctors are giving patients who need consultations with specialists in other departments physical copies of reports or sharing documents with their colleagues on the WhatsApp social media platform.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181647-epamdghotw-1669811040.jpg

“A new party like the AAP getting 15 to 20% vote share in a state considered as BJP’s stronghold is a big thing,” Kejriwal said.
He also thanked the residents of Delhi saying that he is also hopeful of a win in the city’s civic body polls.
Multiple exit polls on Monday predicted that the Aam Aadmi Party is likely to finish in third place – after the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress – in the Assembly elections in Gujarat.
According to NDTV’s poll of polls, an average of several predictions, the Aam Aadmi Party could emerge victorious in eight out of 182 seats in Gujarat.
A poll conducted by India Today-Axis predicts that the party could win 9 to 21 seats in the elections.
Meanwhile, in the National Capital, exit polls predicted a clear majority for the Kejriwal-led party in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi election.
According to the India Today-Axis exit poll, the Aam Aadmi Party could win 149 to 171 wards out of a total of 250.
Another exit poll by Times Now-Navbharat said that the Kejriwal-led party is likely to win 146-156 wards.

Rawal had remarked that the residents of Gujarat could tolerate inflation, but not Rohingya migrants living next door. He also asked whether people would “cook fish for the Bengalis” with their gas connections.
“If gas cylinders get expensive, they will become cheaper again,” the former BJP MP from the Ahmedabad East constituency said. “If inflation goes up, it will come down. People will get employment too. But what if Rohingya migrants and Bangladeshis start living around you, like in Delhi?”
He had further said: “What will you do with the gas cylinders? First cook fish for the Bengalis?”
Rawal’s remarks were criticised by many members of the Bengali community and others on social media.
Mr. @SirPareshRawal:

Bengalis don’t need you to “cook fish” for them.

Remember you too have made your career in Maharashtra where we lovingly fed you dhokla & fafda.

On Friday, Rawal apologised for hurting the sentiments of the community.
“Of course the fish is not the issue as Gujaratis do cook and eat fish,” he said in reply to a user on Twitter. “But let me clarify – by Bengali I meant illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya. But still if I have hurt your feelings and sentiments, I do apologise.”

However, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Salim filed a police complaint against Rawal in Kolkata. Salim has accused the actor-politician of promoting hatred against Bengalis.
“Such speech on public domain has been made to provoke riots and destroy harmony between Bengali community and other communities across the country, and cause public mischief,” the CPI(M) leader said. He claimed that the comments insinuated that all Bengalis are “foreigners and/or illegal immigrants”.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183756-tjlqtzaawq-1669975100.jpg

Bano has approached the court against its judgement from May that allowed the Gujarat government to decide on the remission of the sentences of the convicts. She has also challenged the premature release of convicts.
The 11 men were convicted for having gangraped Bano in a village near Ahmedabad on March 3, 2002, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. She was 19 and pregnant at the time. Fourteen members of her family were also killed in the violence, including her three-year-old daughter whose head was smashed on the ground by the perpetrators.
The men were freed on August 15 from a Godhra jail after the Gujarat government approved their application under its remission policy.
In a statement, Bano on Thursday said that for a long time after the men were released, she was “paralysed with shock” and feared for her children.
“But, the spaces of my silence were filled with other voices; voices of support from different parts of the country that have given me hope in the face of unimaginable despair,” she said.
Read the full statement of Bilkis Bano:
“The decision to once again stand up and knock on the doors of justice was not easy for me. For a long time, after the men who destroyed my entire family and my life were released, I was simply numb. I was paralysed with shock and with fear for my children, my daughters, and above all, paralysed by loss of hope.
But, the spaces of my silence were filled with other voices; voices of support from different parts of the country that have given me hope in the face of unimaginable despair; and made me feel less alone in my pain. I cannot express in words what this support has meant to me. And how much it has helped rekindle my faith in humanity, renewed my courage and allowed me to believe yet again in the idea of justice.
So, I will stand and fight again, against what is wrong and for what is right. I do this today for myself, for my children, and for women everywhere.”",https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/57839-klnizeyuyl-1494393324.jpg

In a tweet posted hours after Lapid made the remarks, Sen wrote jury members did not speak about their “likes and dislikes” at the official press conference of the event and the jury board’s presentation to the festival director.
On Monday, Lapid had said that the movie was unworthy of being included in the film festival’s International Competition section. He had said that “all the jury members” were “disturbed and shocked” by Agnihotri’s film, which explores the exodus of Pandits from Kashmir in the 1990s.
In his tweet, Sen added: “As juror, we are assigned to judge the technical, aesthetic quality and socio-cultural relevance of a film. We don’t indulge in any kind of political comments on any film and if it is done, it is completely in personal capacity – nothing to do with esteemed jury board.”

Lapid is a director from Israel whose Synonyms and Ahad’s Knee have won major awards at film festivals.
At a press conference held on Monday evening before the closing ceremony, Lapid had appreciated the quality of films in International Competition section, adding however, that there is always scope for improvement in selection, according to a press release from the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
Sen had told the reporters at the briefing that this year’s International Film Festival of India was the best that he had seen.
“The kind of diversity, colour and presentation of India as a country were all very good. Considering the various aspects of festivals, I can surely say that IFFI is at par with many international film festivals,” he said.
At the closing ceremony, where Lapid criticised The Kashmir Files, the audience included Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Singh Thakur, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Union Ministers of State L Murugan and Shripad Naik.
Among the international guests at the festival were Lior Raz and Avi Isaacharoff, the creators of Fauda, the popular terrorism-themed show from Israel. The series’s fourth season was premiered at IFFI. In a previous statement, Thakur spoke of an “effective audio-visual” treaty between India and Israel.
Raz and Isaacharoff were at the closing ceremony, along with Naor Gilon, Israel’s Ambassador to India.

Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a five-star hotel in Delhi on January 17, 2014. The police had charged Tharoor in May 2018 with abetment to suicide and marital cruelty.
However, in August last year, the trial court discharged the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram. Special judge Geetanjali Goel had said that the court found no evidence to show that Tharoor acted in a manner that provoked, encouraged or incited Pushkar to die by suicide.
At Thursday’s hearing in the High Court, Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, pointed out that there was a 15-month delay in filing the case.
“The petition copy has not been served on us,” he also said. “They [the police] have deliberately used the email id [to send the petition copy] which was suspended by them.”
The High Court then issued a notice to the police to file a condonation of delay in the case. In legal parlance, condonation refers to when a person or a party has ignored an offence or forgiven it earlier, but later wants to file a legal complaint.
Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes a limitation period for courts to take cognisance of an offence, depending on its severity. However, Section 473 of the CrPC states that a court can take cognisance of an offence after the expiry of limitation period if it is satisfied that the delay has been properly explained or it is necessary to do so for imparting justice.
The High Court also recorded Delhi Police’s submission that the documents in the case will not be supplied to anyone who is not a party to the case. The matter will be heard on February 7.",https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/16038593877_bdf12732bb_o.jpg

The police said that the woman, Poonam, and her son, Deepak, chopped the body into 10 pieces, stored them in a fridge and disposed them of in East Delhi’s Pandav Nagar over several days. The man who was killed has been identified as Anjan Das.
The alleged killing took place on May 30. Deputy Commissioner of Police Amit Goel said that some of the body parts were recovered on June 5 from Ramlila Maidan. “Then for the next three days two legs, two thighs, a skull and a forearm were recovered,” he said.

Goel added that closed circuit footage was analysed around the area and door-to-door investigation was done.
The deputy commissioner of police said that Das had been missing for the past five to six months, and the family had not filed a missing complaint, according to The Indian Express. “This created suspicion in our minds and Poonam and son Deepak were picked up,” he said. “They confessed to his murder upon questioning.”
CCTV footage also showed them walking towards a vacant ground with a bag on several nights, allegedly containing body parts.
Poonam reportedly told the police that she had become fed up with Das, who was her second husband. The woman said that she got married for the first time when she was 13 to 14 years old, Special Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav said. However, her first husband left her and went to Delhi, he said.
“She came here looking for him but then moved in with a man named Kallu,” Yadav said. “The couple have three children including Deepak. Kallu later died of liver failure. She then got married to Das in 2017.”
The police said that Das had not told Poonam that he was previously married and had eight children. “Deepak, meanwhile, complained that Das had ill intentions towards his wife, while Poonam claims he was harassing her sister,” Yadav said. “They also said he would take their money.”
Poonam and Deepak allegedly told the police that they mixed sleeping pills in Das’ drink and slit his throat after he was sedated.
Das was a resident of Bihar, unidentified officials told PTI. A team will be sent there to collect DNA samples of his relatives to check if they match with the victim.
The incident took place almost a month after 27-year-old Shraddha Walkar was killed by her live-in partner Aftab Poonawala.
Poonawala was arrested on November 12 after the police said that he confessed to killing Walkar and chopping her body into several pieces.

Around 300 demonstrators gathered at the city’s Middle Urumqi Road in tribute to the 10 persons who were killed in a fire at a high-rise building in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, on Thursday.
The protestors claimed that the victims could not escape as the building was partially locked down, reported The Associated Press. However, city officials had denied the claim and instead blamed the residents, saying their ability to rescue themselves was “too weak”.
Since the deaths, protests against the government’s incessant use of lockdowns have taken place at various cities across China, including in Xinjiang.

Videos shared on social media about the Shanghai protests showed the crowd shouting slogans such as “lift lockdown for Urumqi”, “lift lockdown for Xinjiang”, “lift lockdown for all of China”, “down with the Chinese Communist Party”, “down with Xi Jinping” and “free Urumqi!”
Some of the demonstrators held up blank sheets of paper as a symbol of protest against censorship.
In several videos, protestors could be heard shouting slogans calling for Xi and the Communist Party of China to step down from power, according to CNN. Some of them also chanted: “Don’t want Covid test, want freedom!” and “Don’t want dictatorship, want democracy!”
Protests broke out in several universities, including the Peking University in Beijing. A slogan at the Peking University read: “Open your eyes and look at the world, dynamic zero-Covid is a lie.”
An unidentified student told CNN that security guards subsequently covered the slogan with black paint.
China’s ruling Communist Party follows a “zero-Covid” strategy that aims to isolate every case and eliminate the virus entirely to prevent overwhelming healthcare systems.

Delhi court dismisses three complaints against ‘Newslaundry’ alleging tax evasion,"Nov 30, 2022 · 10:42 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038646/delhi-court-dismisses-three-complaints-against-newslaundry-alleging-tax-evasion,"A Delhi Court has dismissed three complaints filed by the Income Tax department against news website Newslaundry, its co-founder Abhinandan Sekhri and others in connection with the valuation of the company’s shares, reported Bar and Bench on Tuesday.
An Income Tax officer had accused Sekhri, the company’s partner Chartered Accountancy firm and others of criminal conspiracy. The officer had alleged that they evaded tax by issuing shares based on a bogus valuation report that failed to account for the company’s losses in the previous assessment years.
In its order, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Anurag Thakur said that there was no criminal conspiracy in the case as the valuation report was genuine and in compliance with the Income Tax guidelines. “It is also not the case of the complainant that there was any wrong entry in the books of accounts, balance sheet and income tax return,” the judge said, reported Live Law.
The court also said that most startups incur losses in the initial phase because businesses have a gestation period. Citing the example of internet-based platforms such as Flipkart, Zomato and Amazon India, Thakur noted that these firms incur massive losses year after year but still private equity investors value them at tens of thousands of crores and subscribe.
“Seen in this context coupled with the fact that the accused company has started making profit and is generating cash from operations, the valuation of equity shares given by the valuer as per DCF method [discounted cash flow] does not seem to be lofty at all and it certainly can not be termed as bogus,” the court added.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/163900-liauhzvbbn-1669784416.jpeg

The incident took place on November 23 when Justice Sandeep Kumar was hearing arguments in a case against officer Arvind Bharti. He was accused of releasing compensation to a party even when the case was pending before the court, according to Live Law.
In a video of a live stream from Justice Kumar’s court that has gone viral on social media, he was informed that Bharti had previously faced suspension in a vigilance trap case.
Though Justice Kumar adjourned the case to give the parties time to file their responses, he asked Bharti whether he had got his job through reservation.
After Bharti replied in the affirmative, the court allowed him to leave. The exchange can be heard in the video after one hour and 55-minute mark.
However, after the officer left the room, some lawyers present started laughing and said: “Now your lordship will understand the matter.”
Another lawyer present claimed that Bharti would have earned worth two jobs.
Justice Kumar then said: “No, no, nothing will happen to these people. The poor fellow, whatever he might have earned, he might have finished it.”
When asked about Justice Kumar’s remark, Bharti told The Indian Express that he had made the comment in a “lighter vein”.
Last week, another video of Justice Kumar reprimanding the Bihar Police for demolishing a woman’s house allegedly at the instance of the local land mafia had gone viral on social media.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/98594-nqsphwdgju-1535193192.jpg

"NDTV takeover a responsibility, not a business opportunity, says Gautam Adani","Nov 25, 2022 · 05:54 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038344/ndtv-takeover-a-responsibility-not-a-business-opportunity-says-gautam-adani,"Industrialist Gautam Adani on Friday said he sees taking over media house NDTV as a responsibility rather than a business opportunity, reported the Financial Times on Friday.
Adani Group, a ports-to-energy conglomerate, had announced in August that it will acquire 29.18% stake in NDTV through its subsidiary company Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited. This stake is held by NDTV co-founders Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy through promoter company, Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Private Limited.
NDTV had said that the takeover was done without the consent or any sort of notice served to Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy.
The takeover bid has raised concerns that a change in NDTV’s ownership could undermine its independence. NDTV has been critical of the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is considered close the Adani Group founder.
However, in his interview with the Financial Times, Adani dismissed these concerns.
“Independence means if government has done something wrong, you say it’s wrong,” he told the British daily. “But at the same time, you should have courage when the government is doing the right thing every day. You have to also say that.”
The billionaire also claimed that he had invited Prannoy Roy to remain as chair of the news channel.
Adani’s wealth has grown substantially over the last few years making him the third richest person in the world. The Adani Group has diversified its interests in the last few years from coal and ports and expanded into defence, urban water management, small and medium sector lending, power transmission, airports, data centers and cement and green energy sectors.
Now, the billionaire wants to expand abroad into media and consumer sectors, according to the Financial Times.
“Why can’t you support one media house to become independent and have a global footprint?” he told the newspaper. “India does not have one single [outlet] to compare to Financial Times or Al Jazeera.”
Adani Group’s acquisition of NDTV stake
On August 23, AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, bought 100% of the equity stakes in Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited, or VCPL for Rs 113.74 crore.
In 2009, VCPL had given a loan of Rs 403.85 crore to NDTV. According to the terms of the loan, the company held the right to exercise its warrants and convert the loan amount into equity shares – which it did after being brought by the Adani Group.
The media company has also written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, asking the markets regulator to determine if its 2020 order barring its promoters from making any deals in the securities market restricts the Adani Group from acquiring its shares.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178869-qeycnxpngw-1661274359.jpg
New Delhi dismisses China’s objection to India-US military drills near LAC,"Dec 02, 2022 · 09:08 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038833/new-delhi-dismisses-chinas-objection-to-india-us-military-drills-near-lac,"New Delhi on Thursday dismissed China’s objections to India-United States joint military drills being conducted in Uttarakhand near the Line of Actual Control.
“We don’t give veto to anyone in the relationship we have with the US,” Union Ministry of External Affairs spokespersons Arindam Bagchi told reporters at a media briefing. “So we would like to do exercise with whomsoever we like to or do things like that, I will not comment beyond that.”
India is currently holding its 18th joint military exercise with the US at the hill town of Auli. Earlier, these exercises had taken place in other parts of North India, but this year’s drills are being held only about 100 kilometers from the Line of Actual Control.
On Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry had raised objections against the exercise, saying it violates border management agreements signed between Beijing and New Delhi in 1993 and 1996 in order to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control, reported the Hindustan Times.
At the media briefing, Bagchi said that the drills have nothing to do with the agreements.
“But since these [objections] were raised and we are talking about them, and they are raised by the Chinese side, let me emphasise that the Chinese side needs to reflect and think about its own breach of these agreements of 1993 and 1996,” he said. “India exercises with whomsoever it chooses to and it does not give a veto to third countries on this issue.”
New Delhi has accused China’s People’s Liberation Army of violating several border management agreements and protocols by massing troops along the Line of Actual Control and building infrastructure in disputed regions.
Meanwhile, Bagchi refused to comment on a Pentagon report that claimed that following the Galwan clash in June 2020, China had warned United States officials to not interfere with its relationship with India.
Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash. China had put the number of casualties on its side at four. Since the clash, India and China have been locked in a border standoff.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183737-qkawrrwwwo-1669952299.jpg
Maharashtra to set up panel to look into reasons for industrial companies not investing in state,"Nov 30, 2022 · 08:06 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038712/maharashtra-to-set-up-panel-to-look-into-reasons-for-industrial-projects-not-investing-in-state,"The Maharashtra government will form a three-member committee to look into why several large industrial companies went to destinations other than the state, PTI reported.
State Industries Minister Uday Samant said on Wednesday that the panel will be headed by a retired judge. The committee, which will also comprise two retired bureaucrats, will release a white paper soon to bring out the facts on the subject, he added.
The minister said that the committee will submit its report in 60 days.
In the past few months, the Eknath Shinde-led government in the state has been facing criticism from Opposition parties in connection with claims that the state lost out to other regions in the country in terms of attracting big-ticket industrial projects.
Samant said that a perception was being created that such firms began choosing other destinations only after the new government came to power in the state.
The minister claimed that the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi government failed to create an environment conducive to industry, ABP Majha reported. He claimed that projects worth Rs 50,000 crore would come up in the state in the upcoming days, and that contracts have been signed for projects worth Rs 30,000 crore.
In the past three months, at least four industrial projects went to states other than Maharashtra, although the western state was among the contenders for them, according to The Indian Express.
In September, mining conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Gujarat government to set up a semiconductor manufacturing unit in the state.
The two companies had earlier held talks with the Maharashtra government and the 1.54 lakh crore-deal was reportedly “almost done”.
The Opposition alleged that the Maharashtra government handed over the project to Gujarat under pressure from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in view of the upcoming Assembly polls in his home state. However, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had challenged the Opposition to show a single document that could prove that the project was earlier meant to be set up in the state.
Maharashtra had also reportedly proposed to set up a medical devices park in Aurangabad. The Union government rejected Maharashtra’s proposal, but approved those sent by Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183658-tssvhdbxjz-1669814963.jpg

Vikas Kumar, a Hindu, had identified himself as Rashid Khan, a resident of Bulandshahr, while speaking to an anchor of a YouTube channel. In a video widely shared on social media, Kumar says it is normal to murder someone and chop the body into pieces if the murderer is in a fit of rage. He said that he too would do so.
On Friday, Bulandshahr Senior Superintendent of Police Shlok Kumar said that a police team had been deployed to trace the person after the video was shared by several social media users.
“A person claiming to be Rashid made an objectionable comment,” Kumar said. “He has been taken into custody.”

Poonawalla is currently in police custody.
Meanwhile, Kumar told reporters on Friday, that he has earlier been accused in cases of theft. He added that he was not aware that he would land in trouble for making the comments about Walkar’s murder.

"Karnataka government wants to introduce Uniform Civil Code, says CM Basavaraj Bommai","Nov 26, 2022 · 01:44 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038383/karnataka-government-wants-to-introduce-uniform-civil-code-says-cm-basavaraj-bommai,"Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Friday that his government was seriously considering implementing a Uniform Civil Code in the state, The New Indian Express reported.
Addressing a training camp organised by the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, Bommai said that the Constitution says that the government should not deny any Indian equality before the law.
“It means that laws apply equally to all, regardless of a person’s status or religion,” he said, according to The Times of India.
A Uniform Civil Code involves having a common set of laws governing marriage, divorce, succession and adoption for all Indians, instead of allowing different personal laws for people of different faiths.
The aim of such uniformity is meant to ensure equality and justice for women in particular, who are often denied their rights in marriage, divorce and inheritance under patriarchal personal laws.
In Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, two states going to polls in November and December, the BJP has promised to form panels to implement the Uniform Civil Code if it wins. The BJP formed a similar panel in Uttarakhand after it came to power in the hill state.
Opposition leaders have claimed that such a move would be illegal, arguing that only the Union government can implement a civil code. Meanwhile, legal experts believe that while it is technically possible for state governments to introduce the Uniform Civil Code, implementing the set of laws could prove to be complex.

Polling was held in 250 wards across the national capital on December 4, during which a voter turnout of 50.47% was recorded.
On Wednesday, after the results became clear, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal thanked the residents of the city for their support.
“At first, people gave us the responsibility of fixing schools and hospitals, and we did that,” Kejriwal said. “Now, Delhi has given its son the responsibility to ensure cleanliness...I will be indebted to the people of Delhi.”
जितने Candidates जीते, सबको बधाई, BJP-Congress वालों को भी बधाई।

जो हारे, मायूस मत होना, दिल्ली की सफ़ाई में आपका भी योगदान होगा।

बस, राजनीति हो गई। अब सभी को मिलकर काम करना है।

प्रधानमंत्री जी का आशीर्वाद और केंद्र का सहयोग भी चाहिए।

Kejriwal also congratulated the winning candidates, including those from the BJP and Congress.
“Politics is now over,” he said. “We have to improve the condition of Delhi and we need cooperation from the BJP and the Congress. We also seek the blessings of Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”
Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the Aam Aadmi Party defeated the biggest and “most negative” party in Delhi – in a reference to the BJP.
“Heartfelt gratitude to the people of Delhi for trusting the Aam Aadmi Party,” Sisodia wrote in a tweet. “For us, this is not only a victory but a big responsibility.”
However, BJP leader Amit Malviya suggested that the election for the mayor’s post remained an open contest.
“It will all depend on who can hold the numbers in a close contest, which way the nominated councillors vote etc,” he said on Twitter. “Chandigarh has a BJP Mayor, for instance.”
In January, the BJP’s Sarabjit Kaur was elected as the mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation even though the AAP won the most number of seats in the civic body’s General House.
Now over to electing a Mayor for Delhi…

It will all depend on who can hold the numbers in a close contest, which way the nominated councillors vote etc.

Chandigarh has a BJP Mayor, for instance.

Paresh Rawal summoned by Kolkata Police on December 12 for ‘cook fish for Bengalis’ remark,"Dec 07, 2022 · 09:24 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1039191/paresh-rawal-summoned-by-kolkata-police-on-december-12-for-cook-fish-for-bengalis-remark,"The Kolkata Police on Tuesday issued summons to actor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Paresh Rawal for his statement regarding the Bengali community during a poll rally in Gujarat’s Valsad city, reported The Indian Express.
He has been asked to appear before the Kolkata Police on December 12, Joint Commissioner of Police Murlidhar Sharma said.
At the rally, Rawal had said that the residents of Gujarat could tolerate inflation but not Rohingya migrants living next door.
“If gas cylinders get expensive, they will become cheaper again,” the former BJP MP from the Ahmedabad East constituency had said. “If inflation goes up, it will come down. People will get employment too. But what if Rohingya migrants and Bangladeshis start living around you, like in Delhi?”
He had further said: “What will you do with the gas cylinders? First cook fish for the Bengalis?”
On December 2, the actor had apologised for hurting the sentiments of the Bengali community.
“Of course the fish is not the issue as Gujaratis do cook and eat fish,” he had said in reply to a user on Twitter. “But let me clarify – by Bengali I meant illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya. But still if I have hurt your feelings and sentiments, I do apologise.”
Rawal was booked on a complaint lodged by Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Salim, who accused the actor of promoting hatred against Bengalis.
“Such speech on public domain has been made to provoke riots and destroy harmony between Bengali community and other communities across the country, and cause public mischief,” the CPI(M) leader said. He claimed that the comments insinuated that all Bengalis are “foreigners and/or illegal immigrants”.
A case was registered under Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153B (imputation, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 504 (intentional interest with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.
On the summons issued to Rawal on Tuesday, Salim said that the basic intention of the BJP is to disrupt harmony, reported the Hindustan Times.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183979-jqzlwbmgii-1670383741.jpeg

According to the police, Khan said at the rally that he had been a minister in four governments and that if he were to use his power, “even a baby in its mother’s womb would have sought his permission before coming out”.
He made the remarks on November 29 in the rally held in support of Samajwadi Party candidate Asim Raja in Rampur, according to Circle Officer (City) Anuj Kumar Chaudhary.
Bye-elections for the Assembly constituency of Rampur will be held on December 5. The bye-poll has been necessitated by Khan’s disqualification as an MLA on account of his conviction in a hate speech case.
A complaint about the speech on November 29 was filed by a Rampur resident named Shehnaz, the Hindustan Times reported.
The police have booked the former state minister under provisions of the Indian Penal Code dealing with sexual harassment, statements conducive to public mischief, and words or gestures insulting the modesty of women. The first information report also invokes provisions of the Representation of the People Act.
Khan already faces more than 80 cases that have been filed against him since 2017.
In May, he was released from a jail in Sitapur after being in custody for over two years in connection with a land-grabbing case. The Supreme Court had given him interim bail in the case where he was accused of illegally acquiring a 13.84-hectare plot in Rampur district for constructing the Mohammed Ali Jauhar University.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/39360-fdwxqrooes-1564381245.jpg

A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Abhay Ahuja said that the decision was taken on account of the public interest attached to the project.
The bench passed the order on a plea filed by the National High Speed Rail Corporation in 2020. A detailed order is awaited.
The corporation had initially sought to cut 53,467 trees but reduced the number after the court asked them to do so, according to Live Law.
The National High Speed Rail Corporation had also assured the court it would plant five times the total mangrove trees that were earlier proposed to be felled and the number would not be reduced for the same.
The plea was opposed by a non-governmental organisation, Bombay Environmental Action Group, saying that no study was undertaken about the survival rate of saplings to be planted as a compensatory measure, reported PTI. It also said that no Environmental Impact Assessment report for felling trees was provided.
According to the 2018 order of the Bombay High Court, there is a total freeze on the destruction of mangroves across the state. High Court permission is required if any authority wishes to fell mangroves for any public project.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184102-ytbqtrhcth-1670573898.jpg
"We stand by IFFI jury head’s criticism of ‘The Kashmir Files’, say three panel members","Dec 03, 2022 · 03:59 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038948/we-stand-by-iffi-jury-heads-criticism-of-the-kashmir-files-say-three-panel-members,"Three members of the International Film Festival of India jury on Saturday said that they stand by Israeli director Nadav Lapid’s criticism of The Kashmir Files.
At the closing ceremony of the festival on Monday, Lapid, the head of the jury, had denounced the film directed by Vivek Agnihotri, calling it “propaganda” and a “vulgar movie”. Lapid added that he and other jury members had been “shocked and disturbed” that the film had been included in the event’s International Competition section.
The film explores the exodus of Pandits from Kashmir in the 1990s.
Hours later, director Sudipto Sen, the only Indian panel member, had claimed that Lapid was speaking in his personal capacity and his criticism did not reflect the views of the panel.
However, the remaining members of the panel – American producer Jinko Gotoh, French film editor Pascale Chavance and French documentary filmmaker Javier Angulo Barturen – disagreed with Sen, saying that Lapid made the statement on behalf of the jury.
They also clarified that the statement was not political.
“We were making an artistic statement, and it saddens us greatly to see the platform being used for politics and subsequent personal attacks on Nadav,” the statement said. “That was never the intention of the jury.”
In his speech at the closing ceremony, Lapid had said: “It felt to us totally like a propaganda, vulgar movie inappropriate for an artistic competitive section of such a prestigious film festival. I feel totally comfortable to share openly these feelings here with you on the stage since the spirit that we felt in the festival can surely accept also a critical discussion, which is essential for art and for life.”
His statement had sparked outrage.
Naor Gilon, Israel’s ambassador to India, had said on Tuesday that the criticism could have implications on Tel Aviv’s diplomatic team in New Delhi.
“You will go back to Israel thinking that you are bold and ‘made a statement,” Gilon had said in an open letter to the Israeli filmmaker. “We, the representatives of Israel, would stay here. You should see our DM [direct message] boxes following your ‘bravery’ and what implications it may have on the team under my responsibility.”
Some Opposition leaders and journalists, including Rana Ayyub and Supriya Shrinate, backed the criticism of the film.
The Kashmir Files director, however, said he would quit direction if Lapid and “intellectuals and urban Naxals” who supported criticism of the movie could prove that the events depicted in it are false.

Meanwhile, Gilon on Saturday shared the screenshot of one of many abusive messages on social media he has been on the receiving end of. This one told him to leave India.
The person, whose identity Gilon did not reveal, also praised German dictator Adolf Hitler for “burning down” Jews.
In his tweet, the ambassador said that he just wanted to show was one of the few such messages he had been getting following The Kashmir Files controversy.
In another tweet, Gilon, however, clarified the message he received does not reflect that friendship he enjoys in India and on social media. He thanked those who came out in his support.
“Just wanted this to be a reminder that anti-Semitism sentiments exist, we need to oppose it jointly and maintain a civilized level of discussion,” he added.

Kerala HC dismisses plea seeking directions that governors cannot withhold Bills indefinitely,"Nov 30, 2022 · 05:33 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038679/kerala-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-directions-that-governors-cannot-withhold-bills-indefinitely,"The Kerala High Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a petition seeking a declaration that a governor does not have the power to indefinitely withhold Bills passed by the state Assembly, PTI reported.
The detailed order in the case is not yet available.
In his petition, lawyer PV Jeevesh had also urged the court to give directions to the Centre to amend the Constitution in order to set a time limit within which the president of India or state governors must take a decision on the Bills sent to them for their assent.
The petitioner-lawyer cited six Bills, including the Lok Ayukta (Amendment) Bill and University Laws (Amendment) Bill, which he said Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has been withholding indefinitely.
Under Article 200 of the Constitution, governors and the president have the power to grant or withhold assent to Bills passed by state Assemblies and Parliament.
In his plea, Jeevesh argued that Khan was being “contumacious, arbitrary, despotic, and antithetical to the democratic values” by holding back the Bills, Bar and Bench reported.
Kerala government vs governor
On October 23, a controversy had erupted after Khan directed vice chancellors of nine state-run universities to submit their resignations, citing a Supreme Court verdict. The vice chancellors challenged the order in the High Court.
On October 24, the High Court allowed the vice chancellors to continue in their positions till a final order on the matter was passed by the governor on the basis of show cause notices.
After that, the state Cabinet decided to request Khan to promulgate an ordinance removing him as the sole chancellor of the universities, so that renowned academicians can be appointed to the post.
Meanwhile, the Lok Ayukta (Amendment) Bill was passed by Kerala Assembly in August, allowing the state government to accept or reject the verdict of the body. However, the governor has not given his assent to the Bill since then.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181850-huvehpfzcp-1666755438.jpg
ED attaches assets worth Rs 22 crore of former Andhra MLA in alleged vehicles scam,"Nov 30, 2022 · 04:34 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038683/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-22-crore-of-former-andhra-mla-in-alleged-vehicles-scam,"The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday attached assets worth more than Rs 22 crore belonging to former Andhra Pradesh Telugu Desam Party MLA JC Prabhakar Reddy, his associates and his companies in an alleged scam case related to Bharat Stage-IV vehicles, reported PTI.
The scam pertains to the alleged money laundering of Rs 38 crore in the sale of trucks that violated anti-pollution norms mandated by the Supreme Court. In March 2017, the court had ruled that vehicles not compliant with Bharat Stage-IV emission norms should not be sold in India by any manufacturer or dealer from April 1, 2017.
Even as the sale or registration of trucks that did not meet the Bharat Stage-IV emission norms two companies – Diwakar Road Lines and Jatadhara Industries – bought some Bharat Stage-III trucks from heavy vehicle company Ashok Leyland as scrap, reported NDTV.
The Enforcement Directorate has alleged that the firms then forged the dates on the invoices for the trucks to get them registered in Nagaland, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in 2018, according to the news channel.
The central agency has alleged that these firms are controlled by JC Prabhakar Reddy, his close associate Gopal Reddy, who is a civil contractor from Ananthapur district in Andhra Pradesh, and their family members.
JC Prabhakar Reddy is currently the chairman of the Tadipatri municipality in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.
The central agency is also investigating into Ashok Leyland’s involvement in the case. However, the company has denied its role in the case saying that the matter seems to be pertaining to an old investigation.
“The investigation is not against Ashok Leyland, but against a third party scrap customer,” the company has said, according to PTI. “We have submitted all documents and details as required by the Enforcement Directorate pertaining to this matter, which clearly establishes that we are not implicated in any manner. Ashok Leyland is compliant with all emission requirements.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183646-ufsrieipzi-1669806235.jpg
Delhi High Court tells police to hand over keys of Nizamuddin Markaz to mosque leader,"Nov 29, 2022 · 12:39 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038569/delhi-high-court-tells-police-to-hand-over-keys-of-nizamuddin-markaz-to-mosque-leader,"The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the police to hand over the keys of Nizamuddin Markaz to its leader Maulana Saad as it rejected the law enforcement agency’s petition to continue restrictions on the mosque imposed after it held the Tablighi Jamaat congregation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Live Law reported.
The mosque was closed on March 31, 2020, after the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that was organised at the venue was blamed for thousands of coronavirus cases around the country. The event had renewed the stigma against Muslims, triggering a wave of business boycotts and hate speech.
Several cases were filed against those who attended the congregation for reasons such as allegedly disobeying the government’s Covid-19 guidelines or violating the conditions of their visa. But courts have quashed most of the FIRs and acquitted the members.
In March, the court had permitted the mosque to hold prayers on five of its floors during Ramzan.
On Monday, the court said that the keys have to be returned to the person from whom they were taken.
“Are you in possession [of the keys]?” Justice Jasmeet Singh asked the police. “In what capacity have you taken the possession? The FIR was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act that is over now.”
He also refused to adjudicate on an FIR for the title of the property.
The Delhi Police said that they have not been provided with the documents as to who the actual owner of the Nizamuddin Markaz is and that they can hand over the keys only to the person from whom they had taken possession, reported PTI.
While the police said Saad is absconding, a member of the Markaz’s managing committee stated that the religious leader is on the premises of the mosque.
The court has ordered the police to hand over the keys to Saad after he gives his identity proof. It also said that no documents about ownership are needed for the purpose.
The order was passed in response to the petition filed by the Delhi Waqf Board in 2021, seeking to reopen the Nizamuddin Markaz and remove the ban imposed on the public at Banglewali Masjid.
The police had filed an application in the case asking the Waqf Board and the mosque management to seek details of the ownership of land and building plan. They had argued that neither the Waqf Board nor the mosque committee was able to prove that the property was registered under the Waqf Act.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/139307-knrwmdipph-1613726131.jpg

The case pertains to allegations of bribery and money laundering linked to a deal signed in 2010 with the British-Italian company for the supply of 12 VVIP helicopters to India. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government was in power at the Centre at the time of the alleged scam.
Sushen Gupta, who owns Defsys Solutions, had been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in March 2019 on allegations of money laundering in connection to the chopper scam. He was later released on bail.
Incidentally, in April 2021, French online journal Mediapart had reported that Defsys Solutions had received a payment worth one million euros (Rs 8.62 crore) in connection with the deal to supply Rafale fighter jets to India. The manufacturer of the fighter jets, Dassault Aviation, had not been able to explain the payment to French anti-corruption authorities, the report had said.
On Friday, the defence ministry said that it had received inputs from the Central Bureau of Investigation about the investigation against Defsys Solutions in the AgustaWestland case. The ministry said that business dealings with the firm will remain suspended for a year, or until further orders.

Six arms manufacturing companies have been debarred by the government as well, the circular issued by the defence ministry stated. Besides, business dealings have been suspended with 14 companies and have been restricted with two firms.
The debarred entities include four foreign companies and two Indian ones, according to The Times of India. The four foreign firms are Singapore Technologies Kinetics Limited, Israel Military Industries Limited, Rheinmetall Air Defence (based in Switzerland) and Corporation Defence (based in Russia).
The two debarred Indian companies are Delhi-based TS Kisan & Co Private Limited and Ludhiana-based RK Machine Tools Limited.
Rafale deal - Defsys links
Soon after the Rafale deal was finalised on September 23, 2016, Dassault Aviation had agreed to pay one million euros (Rs 8.62 crore) to Defsys Solutions, one of its sub-contractors in India. Dassault said that money was used to pay for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, Mediapart reported last year.
The French company was, however, not able to provide any proof to the country’s anti-corruption agency, Agence Française Anticorruption, or AFA, to show that the models had actually been made.
In 2017, the AFA had been set up to check whether large companies have implemented the anti-corruption procedures set out in the French law known as Sapin 2, Mediapart said in its report. In October 2018, as various reports flagged possibilities of corruption in the Rafale deal, the AFA decided to audit Dassault.
During this process, the anti-corruption agency came across an item of expenditure in Dassault’s 2017 accounts under the heading “gifts to clients”. The payments made to Defsys Solutions had been listed under this head.
In spite of the apparent irregularity, the AFA, which is answerable to both the budget ministry and the ministry of justice in France, did not refer the matter to the prosecutors, according to Mediapart.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/165076-pouhbzdcai-1634100825.jpg

India saw highest levels of Covid-19 related religious hostilities in 2020: Pew Research Center,"Dec 01, 2022 · 10:06 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038741/india-saw-highest-levels-of-covid-19-related-religious-hostilities-in-2020-pew-research-center,"India saw the highest level of religious hostilities during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, said think tank Pew Research Center in a report published on Tuesday.
At a score of 9.4 out of 10, India fared the worst in Social Hostilities Index in 2020, more than its neighbours Pakistan (7.5) and Afghanistan (8), according to the think tank’s 13th annual study of restrictions affecting practice of religions.
The centre calculates the Social Hostilities Index on 13 questions that measure hostilities both between and within religious groups, including mob or sectarian violence, crimes motivated by religious bias, physical conflict over conversions, harassment for attire for religious reasons, and other religion-related intimidation and violence.

— Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) November 29, 2022
In its report, the think tank made a mention of the decision taken by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to place 900 members of Islamic group Tablighi Jamaat under quarantine after it held a religious congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi in early 2020.
The mosque was closed on March 31, 2020, after the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was blamed for thousands of coronavirus cases around the country. The event had renewed the stigma against Muslims, triggering a wave of business boycotts and hate speech.
Several cases were also filed against those who attended the congregation for reasons such as allegedly disobeying the government’s Covid-19 guidelines or violating the conditions of their visa. However, courts have quashed most of the FIRs and acquitted the members.
The Pew Research Center report also said that India was among the three countries, besides Indonesia and Yemen, where pandemic-related killings of religious minorities took place in 2020. It took note of the two Christians who died after they were allegedly beaten up in police custody in Tamil Nadu on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions.
Jayaraj and his son Bennix were taken into custody on June 19, 2020, for questioning as they had kept their mobile accessories shop open outside permitted hours during the coronavirus lockdown. They were later sent to the Kovilpatti sub-jail. On June 22, Bennix complained of breathing problems and was admitted to a local government-run hospital. He later died at the facility. His father died the next day.
The Central Bureau of Investigation in its chargesheet had said that Jayaraj and Bennix were beaten so badly that blood was splattered on the walls. They were made to clean the blood with their clothes. The CBI added that the two were made to suffer “several rounds of brutal torture”.
India, however, fared somewhat better on the Government Restrictions Index – the second factor on which the report is based – with a score of 5.8.
China was had the highest levels of government restrictions, scoring 9.3 on the index, according to the report.
The Government Restrictions Index is based on 20 questions that assess whether governments restrict religious practices or beliefs. The questions include the extent to which governments try to control religious groups or individuals, prohibit conversions, limit preaching, or hinder religious affiliation by means such as registration requirements and fines.
Several Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states have in recent years such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have passed laws banning forced conversions and are aimed at penalising “love jihad”.
The term has been used by Hindutva outfits to push the conspiracy theory that Muslim men lure Hindu women into marrying them with the sole purpose of converting their brides to Islam.
These laws are stringent in nature with Madhya Pradesh doubling the jail term for forced religious conversions for marriage from five years to 10 years. In Himachal Pradesh, the Bill bans converts from availing themselves of any benefit from their parents’ religion.
However, the state of restrictions in India, on both the indices, was not at their worst levels in 2020. In terms of social hostilities, 2016 was the worst year for India, and 2018 witnessed the highest levels of government restrictions, reported Mint.
The Pew Research Center based its report on several sources including the US Department of State’s annual reports on religious freedom and annual reports from the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, as well as reports and databases from European and United Nations bodies and several independent, non-governmental organisations.
To back up these sources, the think tank cited news reports on Covid-19 produced by organisations including think tanks and university research centres.

Power of the people was undone: Jagdeep Dhankhar criticises SC for striking down NJAC Act,"Dec 03, 2022 · 07:28 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038955/power-of-the-people-was-undone-jagdeep-dhankhar-criticises-sc-for-striking-down-njac-act,"Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday criticised the Supreme Court for striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015, reported Live Law.
“We the people – their ordainment was converted into a constitutional provision,” he said at the LM Singhvi Memorial Lecture. “Power of the people, which was expressed through a legitimate platform, that power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance.”
The comments came amid a rift between the Union government and the Supreme Court over the appointment of judges. Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju had told news channel Times Now on November 26 that the collegium system is not in consonance with the Constitution. On Monday, the Supreme Court had objected to the statement.
Justice SK Kaul had also questioned whether the government was not clearing names for judicial appointments as the Supreme Court had struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act.
The law had proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
The National Judicial Appointments Commission was to replace the collegium system, under which five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, decide on the appointments and transfers of judges to the top court and the High Courts.
On Friday, Dhankhar said that when a substantive question of law is made, courts can look into the problem, reported The New Indian Express. But he added, citing the Constitution, that “nowhere it says a provision can be run down”.
“I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” he said.

“They tried to create a problem for [Prime Minister] Narendra Bhai [Modi], but he taught them such a lesson that they have not dared to do anything till 2022,” Shah said, while addressing an election rally in Mahudha town of Kheda district. “The BJP government has established peace in Gujarat.”
Large-scale communal violence had erupted in Gujarat in February and March 2002 after the burning of a train coach carrying Hindu devotees in Godhra. Official figures say the riots resulted in the deaths of 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus.

The prime minister had visited Morbi on November 1, a day after the bridge on the Machchu river collapsed, leaving 141 people dead.
On December 1, Gokhale had shared a news clipping about a purported Right to Information application which claimed that Modi’s visit to Morbi after the tragedy cost Rs 30 crore. However, on the same day, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a fact check saying that the information was fake.
The news clipping appeared to be from the local newspaper Gujarat Samachar. The newspaper later denied having published the news.
On December 6, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said that Gokhale had made no mistake and that he had been arrested due to the “vindictive attitude” of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Maharashtra FDA recalls batch of anti-anaemic medicine after alleged cases of adverse reactions,"Nov 25, 2022 · 12:31 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038314/maharashtra-fda-recalls-batch-of-anti-anaemic-medicine-after-alleged-cases-alleged-adverse-reactions,"The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration has announced that it will recall a batch of anti-anaemic medicine Orofer FCM after noting multiple incidents of alleged adverse reaction, including the suspected death of a 55-year-old man in Mumbai in September.
Orofer FCM is manufactured by Pune-based Emcure Pharmaceuticals, which supplies medicines to 70 countries. It is administered in the form of an injection.
Pune Joint Commissioner (drugs) SB Patil said that the medicines were recalled as a precautionary measure and added that samples of the medicine were sent for a laboratory test on November 21.
At least eight episodes of adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting and uneasiness, were reported by the manufacturer to the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA.
The Maharashtra unit of the FDA claims that the cases are limited to the state so far. “We are not aware of similar drug reactions in other states,” said Joint Commissioner (drugs) DR Gahane at the FDA headquarters.
Meanwhile, officials said that the 55-year-old man, who died, suffered an anaphylactic reaction after he was administered a 10-millilitre vial of the medicine at Mumbai’s Saifee Hospital on October 12.
The FDA said they are yet to access his post-mortem reports to understand the cause of death.
Gahane said they came to know about the death on November 10 after receiving a complaint from the 55-year-old man’s family.
“Our team collected a sample of the drug from Saifee hospital,” Gahane said. “More samples were procured from other suppliers and sent for testing as per protocol. Since we are required to carry out a stability test, it can take up to 15 days for results to come. We could not risk circulation of the medicine till then.”
An Emcure Pharmaceuticals spokesperson said that the company suspects that the cases of adverse reactions are linked to counterfeits of their products.
“After learning about the counterfeit products, we had filed complaints regarding the counterfeit products with various authorities including the FDA and the police,” the spokesperson said. “As an abundance of precaution and at the direction of the authorities, we are recalling the mentioned batch.”
Orofer FCM is manufactured in Emcure’s Thane unit. The particular batch that has been recalled was produced in May 2022.",https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/85980-txqvztibab-1522675793.jpg

In an interview with NDTV on Thursday, Gehlot had called Pilot a traitor, adding that the Tonk MLA cannot be made the chief minister of Rajasthan if Congress wins Assembly elections in the state next year.
Pilot had hit back, saying it was unbecoming of Gehlot’s stature to use this kind of language to attack him and make false and baseless allegations.
Gehlot’s made the comments in reference to Pilot’s revolt in August 2020 that had pushed the Rajasthan government into a political crisis. The MLA from Tonk had demanded that he be made the chief minister. The turmoil was resolved after the Congress formed a three-member panel comprising Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal and Ahmed Patel to address Pilot’s concerns.
On Sunday, Ramesh, the general secretary (organisation) of the party, said that Gehlot should not have used the words he did in the interview.
He also said that both Gehlot and Pilot are equally important for the Congress, reported the Hindustan Times.
“The individual does not matter – whether there is a senior leader or a young leader,” he said on the sidelines of the Bharat Jodo Yatra. “Because individuals come and go. Organisation matters more.”
Ramesh added: “If a compromise has to be made [between Gehlot and Pilot], then it will be done.”

Mukesh Malaud, the president of Zameen Prapati Sangharash Committee, claimed that 22 of its members suffered injuries in the clashes.
“As per our announced programme, we were peacefully marching towards the residence of CM, but cops tried to stop us with big barricades, trucks and other means,” he said. “But when they failed, they used force on us and our 22 members suffered injuries.”
Kashmir Ghugsher, from the Pendu Khet Mazdoor Union, said that several members of the organisations were hit by batons, The Indian Express reported.
“I recall Bhagwant Mann’s concern when the BJP-led Haryana government had done such barricading during the farmer agitation in 2020-2021,” he said. “Now the same has been done by his government outside a colony where he has a rented house and he hardly visits that place.”

However, the Sangrur senior superintendent of police claimed that no baton charge took place, and that the protest was held in a peaceful manner. “An aggressive faction of protestors indulged in a scuffle, which was later controlled by the police,” he said. “We have taken cognisance of their demands.”
The protestors ended their demonstrators after they got time for a meeting with the chief minister on December 21. However, they said that they would intensify their agitation if the government failed to fulfil their demands.
Malaund said that the protestors were demanding a daily minimum wage of Rs 700.
“Daily-wage employment should be made available on all days instead of only 100 days as under the MGNREGS,” he said. “One third of panchayati land meant for agriculture should be given at nominal rates to Dalit families for farming.”

Eight persons get bail as police fail to prove they did ‘unlawful activities’ after ban on PFI,"Nov 30, 2022 · 12:46 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038656/eight-persons-get-bail-as-police-fail-to-prove-they-did-unlawful-activities-after-ban-on-pfi,"A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to eight persons accused in a case related to the ban on the Popular Front of India after the police failed to prove how could they possibly be involved in “unlawful activities” when they were under detention in the Tihar Jail at the time of the alleged offence, Live Law reported.
On September 28, the Centre had banned Islamic organisation Popular Front of India and its associates for five years under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act because of alleged terror activities.
On September 29, the eight persons were named in a first information report registered at the Shaheen Bagh police station in Delhi. They were accused of “advocating, abetting or inciting/assisting any unlawful activity of unlawful organisation [the Popular Front of India]”, Live Law reported.
On the basis of the FIR, the police arrested Mohd Shoaib, Abdul Rab, Habeeb Asghar Jamali and Mohd Waris Khan on October 3, alleging that six flags of the banned organisation had been recovered from them.
Two days later, the police arrested four others – Abdullah, Sheikh Gulfam Hussain, Mohd Shoeb and Mohsin Waqar – for allegedly shouting slogans in support of the Popular Front of India, and possessing flags and pamphlets of the organisation.
However, at the hearing at a sessions court on Monday, Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal noted that police records show the accused persons were already under preventive custody when the ban on the Popular Front of India was implemented, The Indian Express reported.
He observed that they had been taken into custody on September 27 and released from jail on October 2 and October 4, before being arrested soon again during the early hours of October 3 and October 5.
In his order, the judge said that the investigating officer could not produce sufficient incriminating material against the accused persons to show how they carried out unlawful activities while being in police custody.
The officer in the case had told the court that an investigation was underway to establish a link between the accused persons and bank statements of the Popular Front of India, according to Live Law.
However, the court held that evidence collected in the investigation could not prove how the financial pursuits of the accused persons advocated activities of the Popular Front of India after its ban came into effect.
Advocate Mujeeb Rehman, who appeared for some of the accused persons, told the court that his clients had been picked up unlawfully by the police, The Indian Express reported.
“...They were picked up from the jail itself and were not apprehended from the place as alleged against them,” the lawyer argued. He also presented CCTV camera footage before the court, claiming it showed how the accused persons were taken into custody.
However, the court refused to comment on the footage, observing that the registration numbers of the vehicles seen in the video were not clearly visible.
Ban on PFI
A government notification issued on September 28 alleged that the Popular Front of India and its eight affiliates or fronts have been involved in “violent terrorist activities” with an intent to create a reign of terror in the country, thereby endangering the security and public order of the state.
It also claimed that some of the founding members of the Popular Front of India are leaders of the Students Islamic Movement of India outfit and have links with the terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, both of which are proscribed organisations.
“The PFI and its associates or affiliates or fronts operate openly as a socio-economic, educational and political organisation but, they have been pursuing a secret agenda to radicalise a particular section of the society working towards undermining the concept of democracy,” the notification claimed.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/180499-ddfnarnakl-1664330097.jpg
Gujarat government not appropriate authority to consider releasing convicts: Bilkis Bano in her plea,"Dec 01, 2022 · 12:01 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038749/gujarat-government-not-appropriate-authority-to-consider-releasing-convicts-bilkis-bano-in-her-plea,"Bilkis Bano has said the Supreme Court’s view that Gujarat had the “appropriate government” to decide on releasing the convicts is contrary to provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reported Live Law on Thursday.
Bano was citing Section 432(7)(b) of the code that deals with the power to suspend or remit sentences. It says that the government of the state within which the offender is sentenced has to consider remission as well. The convicts were sentenced by a court in Maharashtra.
Bano made the statement in a review petition filed on Wednesday against the Supreme Court’s judgement in May allowing the Gujarat government to decide on the remission of the life-term sentences of the convicts. She has also challenged the premature release of convicts.
The 11 men had gangraped Bano in a village near Ahmedabad on March 3, 2002, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. She was 19 and pregnant at the time. Fourteen members of her family were also killed in the violence, including her three-year-old daughter whose head was smashed on the ground by the perpetrators.
The men were freed on August 15 from a Godhra jail after the Gujarat government approved their application under its remission policy. On the same day, the convicts were greeted with sweets by their relatives after their release. A member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had felicitated them as well, causing outrage.
An affidavit submitted by the Gujarat government in the Supreme Court in October showed that the Central government’s Minister of Home Affairs had also endorsed the premature release. The state said its decision to release the convicts was based on them spending 14 years in jail and their good behaviour during their time in prison.
In her petition, Bano argued that given the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Maharashtra government should have heard the remission application.
Bano also said that convict Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah, in his remission plea, did not disclose the nature of his crime to mislead the court to get a favourable order. The Supreme Court had ordered the Gujarat government to consider releasing the convicts on Shah’s plea.
Shah “cleverly concealed” the name of prosecutrix Bilkis Bano, which is to date considered a synonym of the brutality of Gujarat Riots, she argued.
The review petition also said that the Shah, in his plea, did not disclose that the Gujarat High Court had dismissed the remission application while observing that the appropriate government to exercise the powers of remission would be Maharashtra.
She submitted that if Shah had disclosed all the facts in his petition, the Supreme Court would not have passed the order it did in May.
Bano added that she was not even made a party in the remission case and so she had no information about the petition till the convicts were released.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/179012-hhihukixih-1661598785.jpg
India abstains on UN resolution to probe Iran’s alleged abuses against anti-hijab protesters,"Nov 25, 2022 · 04:09 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038321/india-abstains-on-un-resolution-to-probe-irans-alleged-abuses-against-anti-hijab-protesters,"India on Thursday abstained from voting on a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution to set up a fact-finding mission into alleged abuses committed against anti-hijab protesters in Iran.
On September 16, violent protests had erupted in the Islamic Republic triggered by the death of a 22-year-old woman in the custody of Iran’s morality police for not wearing hijab.
Mahsa Amini, the Kurdish woman who died, was detained on September 13 in the Iranian capital of Tehran by the police unit that enforces the country’s obligatory dress codes, including the compulsory wearing of the headscarf in public.
Officials say she died of heart attack on September 16 while in custody but critics believe she was physically assaulted on accusations of violating the hijab mandate.
Since September several civilians have been reportedly killed and tortured, especially women who defied Iran’s strictly-enforced Islamic dress code to register their protest.
At Thursday’s UN session, Germany and Iceland brought the resolution that was adopted after 25 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Japan, backed it, reported the Associated Press.
Six countries – China, Pakistan, Cuba, Eritrea, Venezuela and Armenia – opposed the move, while 16 nations abstained from voting.
“The people of Iran, from all walks of life across ethnicities, across ages, are demanding change,” the UN human rights chief Volker Turk said. “These protests are rooted in long standing denials of freedoms, in legal and structural inequalities, in lack of access to information and Internet shutdowns.”

The fact-finding mission will investigate human rights violations “especially with respect to women and children” linked to the protests that erupted on September 16. The resolution also demands that Tehran cooperate with the special rapporteur by granting access to areas inside Iranian territory, including places of detention.
“On many occasions, we have called upon Iran to respect these rights to stop the violent crackdown on protesters, the bloodshed, the arbitrary killing, the mass arrests, the death penalties,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said, reported AP. “The only answer we received was more violence, more death.”
Iran’s Deputy Vice President for Women and Family Affairs said that the resolution was politically motivated move by Germany.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets that the Human Rights Council is abused once again by some arrogant states to antagonise a sovereign UN member state that is fully committed to its obligation to promote and protect the human rights,” he added.

Kamboj made the statement at a press conference held after India assumed presidency of the 15-country United Nations Security Council for the month of December. The presidency rotates every month among member nations, in alphabetical order.
Kamboj said that the roots of democracy in India dated back to 2,500 years to the time of the Shakya clan and the Lichchhavi kingdom – both based in the sub-Himalayan region. She was responding to a reporter’s question on democracy and freedom of press in India.
“Coming down to very recent times, we have all the pillars of democracy – the legislature, executive, judiciary, and the fourth estate, the press, and a very vibrant social media,” Kamboj said. “The country is the world’s largest democracy and, as you know, every five years we conduct the world’s largest democratic exercise.”
The UN ambassador said that everyone in the country is free to say what they want and that is how India functions.
“It is rapidly reforming, transforming and changing,” she said. “And the trajectory has been very impressive, and I don’t have to say this, you don’t have to listen to me. Others are saying this.”

In her opening remarks, she laid out the agenda of the Security Council under India’s presidency, saying that it will focus of two themes – building a new orientation towards reformed multilateralism and on global counterterrorism approach.
Kamboj said that the UN today is “far from reflective of the true diversity of the UN’s wider membership”.
“We do know that everyone does not agree very easily on all issues,” she said. “So if there is some pushback by some countries, that is normal in the United Nations system, that is normal in any negotiation process, but I’m happy to tell you that the broad majority of the membership does feel very strongly that enough is enough and reforms are needed.”
India, along with Brazil, Germany and Japan, have been vocing the need for urgent reform of the UN Security Council, according to PTI.

The professor was heard apologising, to which the student said: “Your ‘sorry’ doesn’t change the way you think or how you portray yourself here.”

On November 17, the Congress had filed a police complaint against Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Bengaluru civic body commissioner and other officials after the allegations were reported by news websites The News Minute and Pratidhvani.
The investigation had found that the NGO, Chilume Educational Cultural and Rural Development Institute, was given permission by civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to conduct a voter awareness drive to revise electoral rolls ahead of the Karnataka Assembly polls.
For carrying out the task, the NGO, which is linked to an election management company, issued fake identification cards for its field agents who impersonated as booth level officers of the Bengaluru civic body, according to The News Minute.
The NGO workers then collected personal information from voters such as their caste, mother tongue, marital status, age, gender, employment and education details, Aadhaar Card number, phone number, address, Voter ID number and email address, the news report said. The workers also asked the voters for information about the performance of their elected representatives.
On Friday, the Election Commission issued directions to suspend additional District Election Officers S Rangappa and K Srinivas. They were in charge of the Shivajinagar, Chickpet and Mahadevapura constituencies, according to PTI.
The chief electoral officer of Karnataka has also been asked to share a list of all deletions and additions done in the electoral rolls of the Shivajinagar, Chickpet and Mahadevapura Assembly seats since January 1, 2002.
The actions were taken after the Election Commission found in an inquiry that unauthorised identity cards, identifying private individuals as booth-level officers of the Bengaluru civic body, had been issued in the three constituencies.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/89354-dvrvgudasa-1525966017.jpg

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party won 22 of the 102 seats it contested in seven districts, including Ambala, Yamunanagar, Nuh and Gurugram.
The panchayat polls for 411 zilla parishad wards in Haryana’s 22 districts were held in three phases between October 30 and November 25.
Those elected to the zilla parishad wards will in turn elect the 22 district chiefs. The state has 143 panchayat samitis, comprising 3,081 members who will also elect their presidents.
The BJP lost all seats in Panchkula and Sirsa, while only two of its candidates could secure a win in Ambala, reported The Indian Express. In Nuh, the BJP won seven seats.
Notably, Sirsa is the headquarters of Dera Sacha Sauda whose chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was granted a 40-day parole in October ahead of the polls.
Singh was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in 2017 for raping two of his women disciples at the Dera headquarters in Sirsa, while last year he was given life imprisonment in the murder case of sect manager Ranjit Singh.
Sunday’s results showed that several Independent candidates have registered wins in the zilla parishad polls. Independent candidate Rajesh Devi beat Suman Saini, the wife of Kurukshetra BJP MP Nayab Singh Saini, to win the ward-4 Ambala zilla parishad, reported The Indian Express.
The BJP has, however, claimed that it has been backing about 151 of the winning Independent candidates, reported the newspaper.

Gokhale was detained on Monday in Rajasthan’s Jaipur by the Gujarat Police for a tweet he had posted about the collapse of a suspension bridge in Morbi. He was later formally arrested after being brought to Ahmedabad.
The Trinamool Congress spokesperson was sent to police custody till December 8.
On December 1, Gokhale had shared a news clipping about a purported Right to Information application which claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Morbi after the tragedy cost Rs 30 crore. However, on the same day, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a fact check saying that the information was fake.
The news clipping appeared to be from local newspaper Gujarat Samachar, according to PTI.
“When we contacted Gujarat Samachar, the management told us this news was never published and it was totally fake and created by someone to look authentic,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crime) Jitendra Jadhav said.
The prime minister had visited Morbi on November 1, a day after the bridge on the Machchu river collapsed, leaving 141 people dead.
On Tuesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that Gokhale had made no mistake and that he had been arrested due to the “vindictive attitude” of the Bharatiya Janata Party. She described Gokhale as a “very bright man” and said that he is very popular on social media.
Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien said the action against Gokhale cannot silence the Trinamool Congress and the Opposition parties.

The repo rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks.
At a press conference, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das made the announcement after the central bank’s bi-monthly monetary policy meeting.
This is the fifth hike in the repo rate since May. The central bank had raised the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.9% in September.
The monetary policy committee, which has three members from the Reserve Bank of India and three external members, raised the key lending rate on Wednesday with a five out of six majority.
GDP projection lowered to 6.8%
The central bank also lowered India’s Gross Domestic Product projection to 6.8% for 2022-’23 from its earlier estimate of 7%, reported The Hindu.
“India will still be among the fastest-growing major economies in the world and that is something that I think needs to be kept in mind,” Das added.
He projected the growth in third quarter to be as low as 4.4%.
Several rating agencies and economic bodies have predicted that India’s economy will slow down as compared to the full-year growth of 6.9% recorded in the previous financial year of 2021-’22.
The second quarter GDP numbers released on November 30 had shown that India’s growth rate slowed down from 8.4% recorded in the second quarter ((July-September)) last year. In the first quarter that ran from April to June, the economy had grown by 13.5%.
RBI retains inflation at 6.7%
At Wednesday’s press conference, Das cited a relatively higher price rise to increase the key lending rate.
The price rise indicator had dropped to a three-month low of 6.77% in October. It was 7.41% in September, 7% in August and 6.71% in July.
However, retail inflation has remained above the upper limit mandated by the Reserve Bank of India for 10 months. The central bank aims to keep inflation between 2% and 6%.
The central bank on Wednesday also retained its inflation forecast at 6.7%.
“Inflation is expected to moderate but the battle against inflation is not over,” Das said, reported PTI. “Pressure points from high and sticky core inflation and exposure of food inflation to international factors and weather related events do remains.”
The RBI projected inflation for October-December quarter at 6.6%, January-March quarter at 5.9%, April-June quarter at 5% and July-September quarter at 5.4%.
Das added that inflation was expected to be above 4% in the next 12 months.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183982-ovvacdbcul-1670388353.jpeg

Both Khalid and Saifi were granted bail in connection with the case. However, they continue to remain in jail as they have been arrested in connection with a larger conspiracy case.
Clashes had broken out on February 23 and February 26, 2020, between the supporters of the Citizenship Amendment Act and those opposing it in North East Delhi. The violence had left 53 dead and hundreds injured. Most of those killed were Muslims.
The FIR in the present case was registered at the Khajuri Khas police station on the statement of a constable alleging that a mob had gathered near the Chand Bagh Pulia (culvert) and started throwing stones.
The constable alleged that while he took shelter at a parking lot, the mob broke down its shutter, attacked those present inside and set vehicles on fire.
Although Khalid and Saifi were not not part of the mob, they were accused of criminal conspiracy in the case. Former Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain was also among those arrested in the case.
Granting bail to Khalid in the case in April last year, the court had said that the activist cannot be allowed to remain in prison on the basis of sketchy material against him.
Noting that the investigation in the case was complete and chargesheet had also been filed, the court had observed that Khalid “cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter”.
The activist has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a case pertaning to alleged larger conspiracy behind the February riots. The Delhi Police claim the violence was part of a larger conspiracy to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and was hatched by those who organised the protests, including Khalid, against the amended Citizenship Act.
He was denied bail by the Delhi High Court in this case On October 18.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183816-pfwfexlntf-1670070563.jpg

The saffron party lost the Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, as well as the Khatauli Assembly seat in the state. The party’s candidates also finished second in the Assembly constituencies of Bhanupratappur in Chhattisgarh, Padampur in Odisha and Sardarshahar in Rajasthan.
The BJP, however, won in the Kurhani Assembly constituency of Bihar and in Rampur constituency of Uttar Pradesh.
Polling for all the seats were held on December 5.
Uttar Pradesh
The Samajwadi Party and its ally, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, have won one each of three electoral contests in Uttar Pradesh.
In the Mainpuri parliamentary constituency, the Samajwadi Party’s Dimple Yadav won against the BJP’s Raghuraj Singh Shakya by a massive margin of 2,88,461 votes.
“I want to thank all the supporters of the Samajwadi Party who worked rigorously for our victory,” Yadav said after the result was declared, according to ANI. “I also want to thank the people of Mainpuri for believing in me. This victory is a tribute to Netaji [Late Mulayam Singh Yadav].”
The Mainpuri seat fell vacant after the death of Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on October 10. Dimple Yadav is the daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav and the wife of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.
Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Madan Bhaiya won from the Assembly constituency of Khatauli against the BJP’s Rajkumari by a margin of 22,143 votes. The bye-election was held due to the conviction of BJP MLA Vikram Singh Saini in a case about the riots that took place in the Muzaffarnagar district in 2013.
However, in Rampur, the BJP’s Akash Saxena won against Samajwadi Party’s Mohammed Asim Raja by 34,136 votes. The bye-poll was necessitated by the conviction of former Samajwadi Party MLA Azam Khan in a hate speech case from 2019.
Bihar
In the Kurhani Assembly constituency of Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district, the BJP’s Kedar Prasad Gupta won against the Janata Dal (United)’s Manoj Kumar Singh by 3,649 votes.
The bye-election took place as Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA Anil Kumar Sahani was disqualified after he was sentenced to jail in a fraud case.
Chhattisgarh
The Congress’ Savitri Mandavi won by 21,171 votes against the BJP’s Brahmanand Netam in the Bhanupratappur constituency in Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-hit Kanker district.
The bye-election was necessitated by the death of Congress MLA and Deputy Speaker Manoj Singh Mandavi in November. Savitri Mandavi is the former MLA’s wife. The seat is reserved for Scheduled Tribes.
Odisha
In the Padampur constituency in the district of Bargarh, the Biju Janata Dal’s Barsha Singh won against BJP’s Pradeep Purohit by a margin of 42,679 votes.
The bye-election was held due to the death of Biju Janata Dal leader Bijay Ranjan Singh Bariha. Barsha Singh Bariha is the daughter of the former BJD MLA.
Rajasthan
The Congress’ Anil Kumar Sharma defeated BJP’s Ashok Kumar in the Sardarshahar Assembly constituency by 26,852 votes, data from the Election Commission showed.

The High Court had made the remarks about Imam in its October 18 order denying bail to activist Umar Khalid in a case pertaining to an alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2020 Delhi riots. The court had said that Imam was arguably at the “head of the conspiracy” to orchestrate violence.
The High Court had also referred to meetings that allegedly took place between Imam and Khalid ahead of the violence.
Imam, in a special leave petition before the Supreme Court, said that the High Court had made observations about him without giving him an opportunity to present his stand. He added that the observations are related to the merits of a criminal case in which he also faces accusations, and thus, the remarks could adversely affect his bail application.
The petition contended that the High Court’s remarks were beyond the scope of a bail application, Bar and Bench reported.
“Notably, none of the impugned observations and remarks are borne out of the record,” the petition said. “Rather, they are ex-facie contradictory and even go beyond the allegations contained in the chargesheet.”
Imam has been charged for allegedly making inflammatory speeches about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which incited riots in the National Capital.
The Delhi Police have alleged that the February 2020 violence was part of a larger conspiracy to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and was hatched by those who organised the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Party MP Parvesh Verma said that the AAP had claimed to be in a position to form the government in Goa, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh as well, but that it had a habit of lying, ANI reported.
“During Covid, no one from AAP was seen working for the people,” he said. “Only MCD workers were standing with people. We’re getting around 210 seats out of 250 in the MCD polls.”
Meanwhile, Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said he was unable to cast his vote as his name was missing from the voters’ list, reported The Indian Express.
“I am at the polling centre where I had come to vote, but the officials told me that my vote has been shifted. However, they did not disclose where my vote has been shifted,” Chaudhary said. “I have registered a complaint with the Election Commission as well and was informed that I will not be able to cast my vote.”
An Election Commission official, however, told The Indian Express that Chaudhary might not have been at his house when a survey was conducted to identify voters living in the area.
First poll since merger
This was the first time that civic elections were held in the capital since the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and East Delhi Municipal Corporation were merged in May.
After the merger, there were 272 seats in the civic body. However, the number of wards was subsequently reduced to 250.
About 1 lakh polling officials, over 100 companies of central armed police forces and 50,000 personnel of the Delhi Police managed the voting process, the Hindustan Times reported.
The elections will decide the fate of more than 1,300 candidates. The BJP and AAP are fighting on all wards, while the Congress has put in candidates in 247 places.
In the civic elections in 2017, the BJP won 181 out of 270 wards, while the AAP won 48 wards. The Congress had emerged victorious in 27 places. Elections were not held in two places due to the deaths of Samajwadi Party candidates.

The total value of the public sector undertaking’s shareholding in the seven Adani Group companies currently stands at Rs 74,142 crore, The Indian Express reported on Friday, citing the business conglomerate’s filings to stock exchanges.
The sharpest rise among LIC’s holdings in Adani Group firms has been in Adani Total Gas, in which the public sector undertaking’s stake increased from less than 1% in September 2020 to 5.77% in September 2022.
Similarly, LIC’s stake in the conglomerate’s flagship Adani Enterprises increased from less than 1% to 4.02%. Its holdings in Adani Transmission rose from 2.42% to 3.46%, and in Adani Green Energy from less than 1% to 1.15%.
The three Adani Group firms in which LIC’s shareholding has not increased significantly are Adani Ports, Adani Power and Adani Wilmar.
The Adani Group is the third largest entity into which LIC has invested after Reliance Industries and the Tata Group, according to Business Standard.
LIC’s investment in the Adani Group in the past two years has been 4.9 times the level of investments by mutual funds in the same stocks, The Morning Context reported. The public sector undertaking, on its own, reportedly accounts for 81.7% of the domestic institutional investment into five stocks from the Adani Group.
An unidentified corporate advisor told the website that the government-owned life insurer has been majorly increasing its investments in Adani stocks without an explanation.
“LIC is increasing its investments in AEL [Adani Enterprises Limited] every quarter without any explanation on what they see as the value,” the advisor said. “As an insurance company, LIC’s equity investments have to be transparent in the interest of policyholders. In my mind, these investments in Adani stocks go against that principle.”
In September, LIC had investments worth Rs 40.99 lakh crore. Out of these, 8.31 lakh crore, or 20.3%, were in equity shares. The insurer received gains of Rs 42,000 crore from its equity investments in 2021-’22, as against Rs 37,000 crore in the previous financial year.
Adani Group’s expansion
In the past few years, the Adani Group has diversified its interests from coal and ports and entered the domains of defence, urban water management, small and medium sector lending, power transmission, airports, data centers as well as cement and green energy sectors.
In May 2019, a report by Scroll.in showed that from 2014 to 2019, the Adani Group expanded its operations substantially despite relatively small profits and also at a time when other infrastructure companies were shedding assets.
In August, CreditSights, a debt-research unit of credit rating agency Fitch Group, warned that the Adani Group was “deeply overleveraged” as the conglomerate had been investing aggressively across several businesses.
CreditSights said that in the worst case scenario, the Adani Group could fall into a debt trap and default.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183759-nyvvfnkdec-1669983370.jpg

In a court filing, the agency claimed that Kavitha, who is the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, was part of a “south group” which paid at least Rs 100 crore in kickbacks to leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party through businessman Vijay Nair, who has been arrested in the case.
The agency also alleged that leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party considered the liquor policy as a device to allegedly generate illegal funds at the cost of the state exchequer, according to The Hindu.
The Enforcement Directorate made the claim while seeking custody of Amit Arora, who was arrested on Tuesday. Arora is the director of Gurugram-based Buddy Retail and a close aide of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia who is also an accused in the case.
Nair, who was in charge of the communication desk in the Aam Aadmi Party, was arrested in the case by the Central Bureau of Investigation in September.
On August 17, the CBI had booked Sisodia and 14 other persons on charges of irregularities in the new liquor policy.
Under the new policy, which was implemented in Delhi on November 17, licences of 849 liquor shops were issued to private firms through open bidding. However, on July 30, the Delhi government withdrew the policy after Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommended an inquiry into it by the central agency.
On September 1, Delhi reverted to its old liquor policy, under which only state-run stores are allowed to operate. According to the first information report, Arora was accused by the CBI of receiving a bribe of Rs 1 crore from a liquor manufacturer on behalf of Sisodia.
On Thursday, Kavitha accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misusing central agencies, reported NDTV.
“Any state where elections are to happen, the Enforcement Directorate arrives before the PM [Modi],” Kavitha said. “You cannot win elections using your central agencies.”
She also accused the BJP of conspiring to destabilise the Telangana government.
Kavitha, however, added that she will cooperate with the Enforcement Directorate in the investigation.
‘Sisodia, others changed mobile phones 170 times’
Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday told the court that there was largescale destruction of evidence in the Delhi liquor policy case, reported The Indian Express.
The agency alleged that 36 accused persons in the case destroyed or used 170 mobile phones between May and August.
“The magnitude of the destruction is such that most suspects, liquor barons, senior government officials, excise minister of Delhi [Sisodia] and other suspects have changed their phones multiple times and this amounted to a loss of a whooping sum of Rs 1.38 crore,” the agency told the court.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178800-lotcffjwyj-1661162089.jpg

Rijiju claimed that that since the Narendra Modi-led government came to power more than eight years ago, it has not done anything to undermine the sanctity of the Constitution, Bar and Bench reported.
The law minister’s comment came at a time when he has repeatedly criticised the collegium system of judicial appointments. Even on Friday, at a separate event, he said that the system lacks transparency, The Times of India reported.
Last month, he had said that the government was unhappy with the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to strike down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act passed by Parliament months after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister in 2014.
The law had proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
The National Judicial Appointments Commission was to replace the collegium system, under which five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, decide on the appointments and transfers of judges to the top court and the High Courts.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had also issued a notice to the Centre asking it to explain its delay in the appointment of judges. The judges were hearing a contempt petition filed last year by the Advocates Association Bengaluru against the Union law ministry not approving 11 names given by the Supreme Court collegium.
At Friday’s event too, Supreme Court Bar Association President Vikas Singh said that the Centre “cannot be seen violating the rule of the law” on appointment of judges, PTI reported.
He added that the Centre cannot “pick and choose” names recommended for appointment by the collegium.
“There is an apparent conflict which is quite obvious everywhere that names are being recommended and not being appointed,” Singh said. “This according to me is a complete negation of rule of law. I beseech the law minister to please ensure that this negation does not happen anymore.”
Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Attorney General R Venkatramani were also present at the event.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/52507-naqsxravrm-1488281471.jpg

On Thursday, the BJP had won 156 of the 182 seats in the Gujarat Assembly elections, putting up the best performance ever by a party in the state polls.
A day later, Patel resigned as the chief minister, along with his entire Cabinet, to pave the way for forming the next government.
Senior BJP leaders Rajnath Singh, BS Yediyurappa and Arjun Munda were present for Saturday’s meeting as the party’s central observers.
The BJP had already announced that the swearing-in ceremony of the new government will take place on December 12. It will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and chief ministers of BJP-ruled states.
The BJP’s performance on Thursday had eclipsed the Congress’ best results, when it had won 149 seats in 1985. The BJP had first secured a clear majority in the state in 1995, winning 121 seats, and has won every Assembly election in the state since then.
However, its best showing was in 2002, when the saffron party won 127 seats in the aftermath of the communal riots that had broken out in the state in February that year. This was also the first election in which Narendra Modi was seeking a full term as chief minister.
He had succeeded Keshubhai Patel in 2001, who had resigned mid-term.

DMK files review petition against Supreme Court verdict upholding 10% EWS quota,"Dec 05, 2022 · 03:59 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039079/dmk-files-review-petition-against-supreme-court-verdict-upholding-10-ews-quota,"The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Monday filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against its verdict to uphold 10% quota in admissions and jobs to applicants from Economically Weaker Sections.
On November 7, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court had upheld the 10% EWS quota in a 3:2 judgement. Justices Dinesh Maheshwari, Bela Trivedi and JB Pardiwala upheld the quota, while former Chief Justice UU Lalit and Justice Rabindra Bhat dissented from the majority opinion.
In an all all-party meeting on November 12, convened by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK president MK Stalin, the decision to file the review petition had been taken.
In 2019, the Union government had introduced the Economically Weaker Sections quota for those who cannot avail of the reservations granted to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, but have an annual family income of less than Rs 8 lakh. However, those from families that own more than five acres of agricultural land or 1,000 square feet of residential land, are not eligible for the quota.
In the petition filed on Monday, the DMK said that the Centre’s move has made a large section of the upper caste population eligible for “easy exclusive luxurious reservations”.
“The Constitution has given them a mask to hide behind the misleading term ‘Economically weaker sections’,” the party said in its review petition. “It is a fact that they have not suffered social stigma nor discriminated against the society or kept away from jobs or from the mainstream.”
On the Supreme Court verdict, the party argued that the Constitution bench had failed to consider the historical and social advantages which exist in favour of the upper castes.
“Reservations as a concept have to be construed to something which is sacrosanct and a step to be taken in extreme caution to offset centuries of oppression,” the plea said.
The party also said that by excluding the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes from the 10% EWS quota, the court had approved of exclusion and discrimination.
“The honourable court has committed an error apparent on the face of the record in para 29 by holding that abolition of reservations will abolish the caste system and lead to an egalitarian society,” the DMK said. “Such a finding is not correct. The caste system is not in existence because of reservations but vice versa.”
EWS quota and Supreme Court verdict
In 2019, the Centre had introduced the Economically Weaker Sections quota for those who cannot avail of the reservations granted to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, but have an annual family income of less than Rs 8 lakh.
Persons from families that own more than five acres of agricultural land or 1,000 square feet of residential land are not eligible for the quota.
The petitioners before the Supreme Court had challenged the 103rd amendment that introduced changes to Articles 15 and 16, which deal with the right to equality and provide the basis for reservations.
The majority verdict of the Supreme Court held that the allocation of the 10% quota fell within the powers vested with the legislature in the Constitution. On the other hand, the dissenting judges said that the quota cannot keep Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes out of its ambit as the Constitution does not allow exclusion.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/182489-lzqrepanfj-1667838964.jpg
Karnataka CM urges Maharashtra counterpart not to send ministers to Belagavi amid border tensions,"Dec 05, 2022 · 07:14 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039089/karnataka-cm-urges-maharashtra-counterpart-not-to-send-ministers-to-belagavi-amid-border-tensions,"Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday asked his Maharashtra counterpart Eknath Shinde not to send his cabinet colleagues to the border district of Belagavi, The Hindu reported.
Bommai said that their visit could disturb law and order in the area.
He was referring to a visit by Maharashtra ministers Chandrakant Patil and Shambhuraj Desai to Belagavi on December 6. They are slated to meet activists from the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, an organisation that has been seeking the merger of about 800 villages with Maharashtra, according to PTI.
The villages are spread across Belagavi district and the north-western and north-eastern regions of Karnataka that border Maharashtra
“It is not right for the Maharashtra ministers to visit Belagavi despite Karnataka Chief Secretary writing to Maharashtra government about it,” Bommai told a group of journalists in Bengaluru. “We have communicated in writing that it is going to create law and order problem.”
The Karnataka chief minister acknowledged that citizens have the freedom to move anywhere in the country, but said that this was not the right time for the ministers to visit the district.
“The state government has certain rights to maintain law and order,” Bommai said. “I have directed the revenue and police officials to take steps that will ensure maintenance of law and order.”
The Karnataka chief minister said that there is harmony among the residents of the two states, and no attempts should be made to disrupt law and order.
Tensions are high in Belagavi because of the border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra.
The border dispute dates back to the period between the 1950s and 1960s when the states were formed. Maharashtra claims that 865 villages on the border should have been merged with it, while Karnataka claims 260 villages because it has the majority Kannada-speaking population.
The dispute was renewed after Karnataka Chief Minister Basavraj Bommai claimed that the Jat taluka panchayats in Sangli district had passed a resolution in November to merge with Karnataka when there was a severe drought and acute drinking water crisis. The chief minister said that Karnataka has formulated a plan to help them.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/162399-gwzzyzazro-1628068947.jpg

The police’s Special Investigation Team had directed him to appear before it on November 21, failing which he was to be arrested.
However, on November 21, Santosh said he had not received the notice, which was dated November 16. The High Court had then said that it could be sent to him through e-mail and WhatsApp. Subsequently, the BJP leader was asked to appear before the special investigation team for questioning on November 26 or November 28.
Meanwhile, Y Satish Reddy, the social media convenor of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which is now called the Bharat Rashtra Samithi after it ventured into national politics, questioned the court’s stay on notice issued to Santosh.
“Why do you need time, if BJP really has no role in poaching case?” he tweeted. “Isn’t this evident to convey who the thief is!”
The case
On October 27, the police had filed a first information report under the Prevention of Corruption Act against a Hindu seer named D Simhayaji, his disciple Ramachandra Bharati alias Satiesh Sharma and businessman Nandakumar, accusing them of trying to lure four Telangana Rashtra Samithi MLAs to join the BJP by offering them large amounts of money.
The four MLAs – P Rohit Reddy, Bheeram Harshavardhan Reddy, P Rega Kantha Rao, Guvvala Balaraju – were seen at a farmhouse in the Aziz Nagar area of Cyberabad on October 26.
On November 3, Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao released videos to back the claims made by his outfit. He alleged that the attempt to poach the MLAs was organised crime that had the support of Santhosh, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP National President JP Nadda.
The BJP, however, has denied the allegations of poaching, claiming that they were a part of “TRS drama”. Union minister G Kishan Reddy has demanded that the Central Bureau of Investigation or a sitting Supreme Court judge look into the case.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183415-jfrffitddi-1669383885.jpg

BBC journalist Ed Lawrence was arrested in Shanghai and was allegedly beaten up by the police, the British public broadcaster said in a statement.
“The BBC is extremely concerned about the treatment of our journalist Ed Lawrence, who was arrested and handcuffed while covering the protests in Shanghai,” the broadcaster said.
The second arrested journalist is Michael Peuker, the correspondent for Radio Télévision Suisse, the French-language branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation. Both journalists have been released.
The protests had broken out in several Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Beijing and Wuhan, after 10 persons were killed in a fire at a high-rise building in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, on November 24.
The protestors have claimed that the victims could not escape as the building was partially locked down. However, city officials denied the claims and instead blamed the residents for being “too weak” to rescue themselves.

The BBC said on Sunday that it was worrying that Lawrence was attacked while he was doing his job. The statement also said the Chinese authorities did not offer any explanation, just claimed that Lawrence was arrested “for his own good” in case he got infected with Covid-19 from the crowd.
“We do not consider this a credible explanation,” it added.
Lawrence, a senior journalist and camera operator for the BBC’s China Bureau, had been tweeting about the protest on Sunday afternoon. The journalist said that he had seen three protestors being arrested of which two had fought with the police.
One man has just approached me to say his flowers were confiscated by police. As he tells me this, two cops come over to listen to our conversation.

Following his arrest and release, Lawrence also said that the police arrested one Chinese citizen who was trying to stop the officials from beating him up.
Meanwhile, Radio Télévision Suisse’s Peuker was arrested after a live broadcast. He knew that he was going to be arrested.
“The tension is at its height here,” he had said during his broadcast. “Proof of this is that I am now surrounded by three police officers, I will be taken on board after this duplex at the police station.”
The correspondent and his cameraman were taken into custody after Peuker went off air. The Swiss broadcaster said that the two were released after minutes of negotiation.
Zero-Covid policy
Several cities across China have imposed lockdowns and other restrictions to curb the spread of the infection, under zero-Covid policy.
Through the “zero-Covid” strategy, China aims to isolate every patient and eliminate the virus entirely to prevent overwhelming healthcare systems. Some of the norms under the policy were relaxed in November. However, the policy, which has been described as unsustainable by the World Health Organization, is seemingly being implemented again.
On Saturday, China had registered a record 39,791 Covid-19 cases, Reuters reported, citing the country’s National Health Commission. Out of these, 3,709 cases were symptomatic infections, whereas 36,082 were asymptomatic.
One person died due to the disease, taking the total number of fatalities to 5,233.

“Such reports are baseless,” said a spokesperson of the Raj Bhavan.
At an event in Aurangabad on November 12, the governor had referred to Shivaji as an “icon of olden times” as opposed to “modern-day” ones like BR Ambedkar and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nitin Gadkari.

On December 1, Gokhale had shared a news clipping about a purported Right to Information application which claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Morbi after the bridge collapse cost Rs 30 crore.
However, on Tuesday morning, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a fact check saying that the information was fake.
The news clipping appeared to be from local newspaper Gujarat Samachar, according to PTI.
“When we contacted Gujarat Samachar, the management told us this news was never published and it was totally fake and created by someone to look authentic,” Jadhav said.
The prime minister had visited the Gujarat city on November 1, a day after a colonial-era suspension bridge on the Machchu river collapsed, leaving 141 people dead.
The first information report against Gokhale has been filed on charges of forgery and printing defamatory content, the police said.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that Gokhale had made no mistake and that he had been arrested due to the “vindictive attitude” of the BJP. She described Gokhale as a “very bright man” and said that he is very popular on social media.
“The police took him into custody because he posted a tweet against the prime minister,” Banerjee said. “So many people post tweets against me...We are really sorry for this.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien, in a series of tweets, said that Gokhale was detained in Jaipur after he landed in the Rajasthan capital on Monday night.
“When he landed, Gujarat Police was at the airport in Rajasthan waiting for him [Gokhale],” he wrote. “At 2 in the morning on Tuesday, he called his ma and told her that they are taking him to Ahmedabad and he would reach Ahmedabad by noon today.”
O’Brien claimed that the police confiscated Gokhale’s phone and other belongings after allowing him to call his mother. He added that a “cooked up case” has been filed against Gokhale by the Ahmedabad Police cyber cell after the spokesperson tweeted about the bridge collapse accident.
He said the action against Gokhale cannot silence the Trinamool Congress and the Opposition parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rajya Sabha MP said, is taking political vendetta to another level.
At 2 in the morning on Tue, he called his Ma and told her that they are taking him to Ahmedabad and he would reach Ahmedabad by noon today. The police let him make that one two-minute phone call and then confiscated his phone and all his belongings. 2/3

Opposition on Modi’s Morbi visit
Besides Saket, the Opposition parties had criticised Modi’s visit to Morbi, calling it a photoshoot for the prime minister.
The parties had slammed the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party too, especially after the visuals emerged showing that the Morbi civil hospital was being renovated just ahead of the prime minister’s visit.
The Congress had called the makeover shameful, saying that while so many have died in the accident, the BJP was busy with event management.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/144955-lungwgilbj-1595653618.jpg
"Arvind Kejriwal is Modi of 2013, defamed Tablighi Jamaat, alleges Asaduddin Owaisi","Nov 28, 2022 · 09:28 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038466/arvind-kejriwal-is-modi-of-2013-defamed-tablighi-jamaat-alleges-asaduddin-owaisi,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday alleged that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has defamed all Muslims in the country and compared him to Narendra Modi of 2013, a year before he became the prime minister, reported PTI.
Owaisi alleged that Kejriwal had blamed Tablighi Jamaat for the spread of the coronavirus disease in the national capital in 2020.
“The lists of Covid-19 cases in Delhi had a column that mentioned Tablighi Jamaat members as super-spreaders,” he claimed while campaigning for the civic body polls. “The entire country started doubting Muslims. The hatred increased and many people were attacked. The Delhi CM is responsible for this.”
In March 2020, a Tablighi Jamaat congregation that was organised at the venue had been blamed for thousands of coronavirus cases around the country. The event had renewed the stigma against Muslims, triggering a wave of business boycotts and hate speech.
Several cases were filed against those who attended the congregation for reasons such as allegedly disobeying the government’s Covid-19 guidelines or violating the conditions of their visa. But courts have quashed most of the FIRs and acquitted the members.
On Sunday, Owaisi also alleged the Delhi chief minister said he would have removed those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh in half an hour.
Shaheen Bagh was one of the many places across the country that had become a spot for protest against the contentious law. The protest at Shaheen Bagh had begun with around 50 women occupying a road in the area. Gradually, the location became a forefront for protest against the citizenship law as the number of demonstrators increased substantially.
As the demonstrations took centre stage, several Bharatiya Janata Party leaders had made inflammatory speeches against the protestors and the Muslim community.
At an event, Union Minister Anurag Thakur was heard shouting “desh ke gaddaron ko” and the crowd responded by saying “goli maaro saalon ko”. The slogan meant “shoot the traitors”, with an expletive used for “traitors” – a reference to those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
In addition, on February 23, Kapil Mishra, who left the Aam Aadmi Party to join the BJP, had amassed a crowd and gave an ultimatum to the police to clear the roads of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protestors holding a sit-in protest at Jaffrabad in Delhi.
This was the day clashes had broken out between the supporters of the Citizenship Amendment Act and those opposing it in North East Delhi, leaving left 53 dead and hundreds injured as it ended three days later. Most of those killed were Muslims.
“A person from his party who later joined the BJP raised the ‘goli maaron...’ slogan,” Owaisi claimed on Sunday, wrongly identifying Thakur instead of Mishra. “The Delhi chief minister got an FIR registered against Tablighi Jamaat, but not against this person. This is his true face... He is the Narendra Modi of 2013 and wants to break all his records.”
He alleged that Kejriwal had disappeared when the violence had broken out in Delhi in 2020. “Houses were burnt and people were killed,” the Hyderabad MP said. “The Delhi chief minister could not be seen anywhere.” he said.
The AIMIM chief also alleged that no party wants to work for the betterment of Muslims, Dalits and the Adivasis.
“When I roam the lanes of Ahmedabad, Godhra, Surat and Vadgam in Gujarat or Jaffrabad and Seelampur in Delhi, I find that places where Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis live remain undeveloped and dirty,” he claimed. “These places have open drains and mountains of garbage, but there are no proper arrangements for clean drinking water, children’s education and hospitals.”

Ramdev made the statement at the Yoga Science Camp and Women’s Meeting organised at Thane on Friday, which was also attended by Amruta Fadnavis, the wife of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s son Shrikant Shinde.
While sharing the stage with Amruta Fadnavis, Ramdev said that many women at the event had brought sarees but did not get the time to wear them because of back-to-back programmes.
“However, you look good in sarees, you look good in salwar suits like Amruta ji, and you look good when, like me, you wear nothing,” Ramdev said. “People wear clothes out of shame.”
The comments by the co-founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth attracted outrage on social media.
“Swami Ramdev’s remarks on women in front of the wife of the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra are indecent and condemnable,” Chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal tweeted. “The comments are hurtful for all women and Baba Ramdev ji should apologise to the country for this statement.”

“How come she [Amruta Fadnavis] remained silent after such a statement?” Raut said. “Any person, however big his stature, who makes a statement should be slapped.

Canada to extend job permits to family members of temporary foreign workers from January,"Dec 03, 2022 · 08:31 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038959/canada-to-extend-job-permits-to-family-members-of-temporary-foreign-workers-from-january,"Canada on Friday announced it was extending work permits to family members of temporary foreign workers. The measure, for a two-year period, will start in January in a phased manner.
In a statement, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship department said that presently spouses of foreign workers are only eligible for a work permit if the principal applicant is working in a high-skill occupation.
Canada is struggling with an acute shortage of workers, especially in skilled industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, building trades and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). Job vacancy data had shown there were 9.58 lakh vacancies in the country in August and 10 lakh unemployed citizens, reported Reuters.
Amid the critical labour shortage, Canada had announced on November 1 that it was planning to add 14.5 lakh immigrants in the next three years.
On Friday, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Sean Fraser said that employers across the country have continued to identify lack of workers as their biggest obstacle.
“Today’s announcement will help employers find the workers they need to fill their labour gaps by expanding work permits to family members at all skill levels, resulting in family members of over 200,000 foreign workers being able to work in Canada,” he added.
The department said that the decision is aimed at improving the “emotional well-being, physical health and financial stability of workers by keeping families together”.
“As a result, it is expected that the worker will better integrate into their overall work environment and community,” it said.
The measure, being implement in three phases, will begin with allowing family members of foreign workers from the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program to apply for an open work permit.
In the second phase, the work permit will be extended to family members of workers from the low-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. The last phase will include consultation with agricultural partners and stakeholders to assess operational feasibility for expanding the measure to family members of agricultural workers.
“Labour is the number 1 challenge facing Canada’s tourism sector as we position ourselves for post-pandemic growth,” said Associate Minister of Finance Randy Boissonnault. “Today, our government is bringing in innovative, family-based solutions to resolve this issue and help our tourism partners grow to meet the global demand for Canadian experiences from coast to coast to coast.”
In the statement, the department said that Canada has issued over 6,45,000 work permits between January and October. This, it said, is nearly four times more than the 1,63,000 work permits issued in the same period in 2021.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183820-ctuifybima-1670079652.jpg

The detailed order passed by Justice Jasmeet Singh is awaited.
Pandey had been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on July 19 and sent to judicial custody.
The former police commissioner was booked by the central agency on money laundering charges on July 14 along with former chiefs of the National Stock Exchange Chitra Ramkrishna and Ravi Narain.
The case is linked to the alleged phone tapping of employees of the National Stock Exchange when the co-location scam took place within the trading platform. The Central Bureau of Investigation has alleged that Pandey had set up a company called iSec Securities, which was used for electronic surveillance of the employees.
The co-location scam pertains to allegations of preferential access to the National Stock Exchange trading platform that allowed certain brokers to trade before the markets opened. The first FIR in the case was filed in 2018.
Ramkrishna and Narain, both former managing directors and chief executive officers of the stock exchange, have already been booked for the co-location scam by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
Pandey was first questioned by the Enforcement Directorate on July 5 for its investigation into a money laundering angle in the co-location scam. He had retired as Mumbai Police commissioner on June 30.
Enforcement Directorate officials allege that the agency had found evidence of secret phone surveillance during the questioning. The agency then informed about the development to the Union home affairs ministry, which asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.
iSec Securities was one of the firms tasked to conduct security audits at the National Stock Exchange between 2010 to 2015, during which the co-location scam allegedly took place. The company did not alert the stock exchange that its servers were compromised, the Central Bureau of Investigation has alleged.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/177361-eybrjprmfb-1658285092.jpg

Gokhale was first held in Rajasthan’s Jaipur on December 5 by the Gujarat Police. He was formally arrested after being brought to Ahmedabad, and subsequently sent to police custody till December 8. The Gujarat Police had alleged that Gokhale tweeted fake news about Modi’s visit to Morbi to get political mileage.
On Thursday, a court in Ahmedabad granted bail to Gokhale, but he was soon re-arrested in another case filed in the Morbi district. A court in Morbi granted him bail again on Friday, according to Live Law.
The Morbi Police accused Gokhale of allegedly “promoting enmity between classes during the elections” apart from spreading fake news about Modi, reported The Indian Express.
The allegations made in this case are on similar lines as the first one that had been registered in Ahmedabad. The prime minister had visited Morbi on November 1, a day after the bridge on the Machchu river collapsed, leaving 141 people dead.
On December 1, Gokhale had shared a news clipping about a purported Right to Information application which claimed that Modi’s visit to Morbi cost Rs 30 crore. However, on the same day, the Press Information Bureau tweeted a fact check saying that the information was fake.
The news clipping appeared to be from the local newspaper Gujarat Samachar. The newspaper later denied having published the news, according to the police.
On Thursday, the Trinamool Congress spokesperson was granted bail in the case by an Ahmedabad court. Party MP Derek O’Brien tweeted about his bail at 4.47 pm on Thursday. However, less than five hours later, O’Brien tweeted that Gokhale had been arrested again at 8.45 pm.
He added that the spokesperson had been taken into custody without any notice or warrant and was being taken to an “unknown destination”.

Supreme Court dismisses plea seeking ‘real history’ of Taj Mahal,"Dec 05, 2022 · 04:48 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039082/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-real-history-of-taj-mahal,"The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition seeking the “real age” and “real history” of the Taj Mahal, PTI reported.
The petition was filed before a bench of Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar by a Haryana resident named Surjit Yadav.
“Do not drag courts into everything,” the bench said, according to the Hindustan Times. “Can we determine what is the age of the Taj Mahal or the historical facts behind it after 400 years?”
It added: “We are not here to reopen history. Let history continue.”
The court then allowed Yadav to withdraw his plea and make a representation before the Archaeological Survey of India, according to PTI.
In his plea, Yadav had contended that as per his research, a mansion already existed at the site where the Taj Mahal is built.
“It is extremely strange why all the court chroniclers of Shah Jahan have not mentioned the name of the architect of this magnificent mausoleum,” he wrote in his plea. “Therefore, this quite clearly indicates that the mansion of Raja Man Singh was not demolished but only modified and renovated to create the current look of the Taj Mahal. That is why there is no mention of any architect in the accounts of the court chroniclers of Shah Jahan.”
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had commissioned the construction of the Taj Mahal in 1632 and the project was finished in 1653. However, some Hindutva pseudo-historians have propounded the theory that the mausoleum pre-dated Shah Jahan and was built long before Mughal rule began in India.
In October, the Supreme Court had dismissed a petition seeking to open 22 rooms of the Taj Mahal to check if they contain Hindu idols or scriptures.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183907-awptpwkudq-1670237885.jpg

"Centre should increase its share in social security pensions, 51 economists tell finance minister","Dec 05, 2022 · 02:10 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039062/centre-should-increase-its-share-in-social-security-pensions-51-economists-tell-finance-minister,"The Union government should increase its share in social security pensions, 51 economists told Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a letter on Monday.
In their letter, the economists said that the Centre’s contribution to pensions under the National Old Age Pension Scheme has stagnated at Rs 200 per month since 2006. The scheme provides financial assistance to the elderly, widows and persons with disabilities in form of social pensions.
“This is unfair,” the economists said. “It is also a missed opportunity. The central government’s contribution should be immediately raised to Rs 500 [preferably more] at the very least. This requires an additional allocation of Rs 7,560 crores or so, based on the current NOAPS coverage [2.1 crore pensioners].”
The signatories include economists such as Jean Drèze, Abhijeet Singh, Ashwini Deshpande, Dilip Mookherjee, Maitreesh Ghatak, Mausumi Das, Paul Niehaus, Rohini Somanathan and Uday Bhanu Sinha.
In their letter, the economists suggested that pensions to widows should be raised from Rs 300 per month to Rs 500 at least, adding that the increase would cost Rs 1,560 crore to the government.
The economists also raised concerns about maternity benefits.
They said that while the government has to legally pay a maternity benefit of Rs 6,000 per child under the National Food Security Act of 2013, it has not acted on it. The Act exempts those already covered in the formal sector.
“In 2017, a scheme was finally launched for this purpose: the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana,” the letter said. “However, the provision made for it in the Budget never exceeded Rs 2,500 crore – less than one-third of what is required based on NFSA [National Food Security Act] norms.”
The letter also pointed out that the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana restricts the benefits to Rs 5,000 for just one child per woman. This, the letter said, is in violation of the 2013 Act.
“The Union Budget 2023-’24 should provide for the full-fledged implementation of maternity entitlements as per NFSA norms,” it said. The economists said this would require Rs 8,000 crore, assuming that the birth rate is 19 per thousand, the coverage of the Act is 90% and the Centre and state contribution is in 60:40 ratio.
They added: “Along with this, the illegal restriction of maternity benefits to one child per woman should be removed.”
The economists also said they had made the same suggestions in 2017 and 2018 to former finance minister Arun Jaitley, but were ignored.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/180407-vbbnhqnxkp-1664112101.jpg

The politician’s comments came days after Gehlot had called Pilot a traitor in an interview with NDTV.
“I don’t want to get into what someone said,” Gandhi said during a press conference in Indore on Monday. “Both the leaders are the assets of Congress. But it will not affect the ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra.”
On November 24, Gehlot had told NDTV that there were no chances of Pilot becoming the chief minister if the Congress wins the Rajasthan Assembly elections next year. “A gaddar [traitor] cannot be chief minister,” he added. “The high command cannot make Sachin Pilot the chief minister...a man who doesn’t have 10 MLAs. Who revolted. He betrayed the party, [he] is a traitor.”
The MLA had hit back, saying it was unbecoming of Gehlot’s stature to use this kind of language and that such “mud-slinging” would not help the party.

He attributed the situation to the alleged distorted financial policies of the Centre, the Covid-19 pandemic and recurring natural disasters in the state.
“It is true that the state is facing an unprecedented financial crisis,” Balagopal said in the Assembly. “However, the reasons contributing to the crisis are beyond the control of the state…that is the fact.”
Balagopal further informed the House that there is a deficit of Rs 6,716 crore in revenue allocated to the state from the Centre for 2022-’23, compared to last year.
He, however, added that the financial stress was a “passing phase” and assured that the state will overcome it soon, reported the Hindustan Times.
“The Left government is trying to overcome the crisis through a strict financial discipline by strengthening the tax collection, avoiding the unwanted expenses and keeping it to the minimum,” Balagopal said, according to PTI.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/177365-afeagvizzs-1658291956.jpg

The court was hearing a writ petition filed by five academics, who have sought directions to the investigating agencies and the police, including seeking permission from a judicial magistrate before accessing or seizing electronic devices and specifying how the material is relevant or linked to the alleged offence.
In a counter affidavit filed on August 5, the Centre had stated that the plea was not maintainable. However, the court was not satisfied with the government’s response and had asked the Centre to file a fresh response.
On November 11, the court had imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the Centre for not replying to the plea. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and AS Oka had asked the government to file the response within two weeks.
In its latest reply, the Centre argued that any blanket order regarding the return of digital and electronic devices of a person under investigation would be inappropriate, according to Bar and Bench.
“While the right to privacy exists in all jurisdictions across the world, the regulation of same through statutory law is permissible and there can be no blanket exclusions,” the Centre said.
It also said that the accused persons in such cases may be allowed to seek cloned images of the hard drives of the devices seized by the investigating agencies, reported Live Law.
The plea
The petition has been filed by Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ram Ramaswamy, Savitribai Phule Pune University professor Sujata Patel, professor of Cultural Studies at Hyderabad’s English and Foreign Languages University Madhava Prasad, professor of Modern Indian history at Jamia Millia Islamia Mukul Kesavan and theoretical ecological economist Deepak Malghan.
In the case of urgent seizures, the petition submitted that reasons for not seeking permission should be provided to the owner of the device in writing. The owner of the electronic device should not be forced to reveal passwords, ideally, a copy of the hard drive should be taken and not the original, and the hard disks must be examined in the presence of the owner of the device.
“The powers of search and seizure, particularly because they engage fundamental rights, ought to be therefore read and supplied with adequate safeguards such that they are not abused to defeat such rights,” the petition stated.
The plea also mentioned that several persons from whom devices have been seized in alleged offences registered in the recent past belong to the academic field or are noted authors.
“The academic community does and stores its research and writing in the electronic or digital medium, and the threat of damage, distortion, loss or premature exposure of academic or literary work in the event of seizure of electronic devices is considerable,” the petition added.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/182489-lzqrepanfj-1667838964.jpg

Several cases of stone-throwing have been reported from Meghalaya, and at least five vehicles from outside the state have been set ablaze in different parts of the state in the last couple of days. The violence got triggered after five villagers and an Assam Forest Guard official were killed in firing by the Assam Police along the state’s border with Meghalaya on Tuesday.
“Yesterday in Shillong, the public burnt police vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner (East) of Guwahati Police Sudhakar Singh told PTI “The situation is not very good. That’s why we are advising people not to travel [to Meghalaya]”
On Thursday night, violence was reported from parts of Shillong after a demonstration and a candlelight vigil was held to pay respect to those killed in the firing, PTI reported. Three police officials were injured after unidentified miscreants threw stones at them. Petrol bombs were also thrown at a police bus and a jeep.

Government offices in Meghalaya functioned with low attendance on Friday as various organisations gave call for a non-cooperation movement in protest of Tuesday’s firing incident.
Unidentified officials told PTI that attendance was thin in both central and state government offices in Shillong and seven districts of the Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills region.
Several social organisations and student associations of Meghalaya, including the Khasi Students Union and the Federation of Khasi Jaintia and Garo People, had called for a statewide non-cooperation movement on Thursday.

“The elite perceptions that only educated or few individuals should have the right to vote shows contempt and distrust towards democracy,” he said.
Chandrachud was speaking at the 8th Dr LM Singhvi Memorial Lecture on Universal Adult Franchise: Translating India’s Political Transformation into Social Transformation.
He also said that since independence, there have been many instances in which individuals have used their right to vote beyond electing candidates and have formed pressure groups to influence prospective leaders.
The chief justice added that this was a true reflection of participative democracy. He also said that electoral democracy has been an agent of pervasive change at the village and municipal levels.
“The reservation of seats for women and marginalised social groups in panchayats has given them the power to shape their own destinies,” Chandrachud said. “There are numerous examples of exemplary work done by women sarpanchs or all-women panchayats in different parts of India.”
He also said that we must underscore the participation of those communities, in the electoral process, who initially did have the right before the Constitution was formed.
“Post-independence history tells us that the marginalised communities such as Dalits have considered the right to vote and the idea of universal adult franchise as the sacrosanct feature of the Indian Constitution,” he said.
The Constitution of India is a feminist and egalitarian document that broke from the colonial era, Chandrachud said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181126-pearyiilvw-1665498068.jpg

The statement came in the backdrop of an alleged ransomware attack on the AIIMS servers on November 23, which disrupted several patient services. On Thursday, AIIMS said that the e-Hospital application, which is used for a range of services, had been restored. However, all hospital services were reportedly still running on manual mode.
The Safdarjung Hospital’s Medical Superintendent BL Sherwal said that the administration received information about the cyber attack on November 14, after computer operators were unable to log in to some devices.
“There was a cyber attack in our hospital system and servers were down but the National Informatics Centre [NIC] was able to revive the systems,” Sherwal said. He added that the attack was not ransomware, according to ANI.
Anuj Agarwal, the general secretary of the resident doctors’ association at Safdarjung Hospital, said that the institution’s services were not as severely disrupted as AIIMS since it carries out most of its operations manually.
“In AIIMS, from taking an appointment to printing prescriptions, everything is digitised,” Agarwal said. “In Safdarjung Hospital, most of our daily operations continue manually. That is a major reason why the impact was not as badly felt.”
In the case pertaining to the cyber attack on AIIMS, the Delhi Police registered a first information report under provisions of extortion and cyber terrorism November 25.

While addressing at the closing ceremony of the International Film Festival of India on Monday, Lapid, who was the jury head, had called The Kashmir Files “a propaganda, vulgar movie”.
He had said that the movie was unworthy of being included in the film festival’s International Competition section and that “all the jury members” were “disturbed and shocked” by Agnihotri’s film, which explores the exodus of Pandits from Kashmir in the 1990s.
In a video message on Tuesday, Agnihotri said that he was used to being attacked by “gangs who want to divide India”.
He added, “What’s surprising is that how an event organised by the government of India was used to support the narrative of terrorists who want Kashmir’s separation from India and how many Indians living in India used it against the country?”

In his speech at the closing ceremony, Lapid had said: “It felt to us totally like a propaganda, vulgar movie inappropriate for an artistic competitive section of such a prestigious film festival.

According to Muslim personal law, the minimum age for marriage for girls is when they attain puberty, which is presumed to be 15 years. However, penal laws and personal laws of Hindus (which also apply to Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains), Christians and Parsis set the minimum age at 21 years for men and 18 years for women.
The women’s panel, in its petition, said that allowing Muslims to marry on the attainment of puberty is discriminatory and that it violates penal laws.
“A person who has attained puberty may be biologically capable of reproduction, however, the same does not imply that the said person is mentally and psychologically mature enough to get married and physically mature to engage in sexual acts and consequently, bear children,” the commission said.
The National Commission for Women noted that the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act does not allow anyone below 18 years of age to give consent for sex. It demanded that the POCSO Act, the Prevention of Child Marriage Act and the Indian Penal Code should be applied equally irrespective of religious or personal laws, The New Indian Express reported.
“Merely because child marriages have been performed as a part of a tradition does not mean necessarily mean that the tradition is an acceptable one nor should it be sanctified as such,” the petition said.

“You will go back to Israel thinking that you are bold and ‘made a statement,” Gilon wrote in an open letter to the Israeli filmmaker. “We, the representatives of Israel, would stay here. You should see our DM [direct message] boxes following your ‘bravery’ and what implications it may have on the team under my responsibility.”
At the closing ceremony of the film festival on Monday, Lapid had described Vivek Agnihotri’s film “a propaganda, vulgar movie” and unworthy of being included in the event’s International Competition section.
In his letter, Gilon said that Lapid should be ashamed for his comments.
“You have abused in the worst way the Indian invitation to chair the panel of judges at IFFI Goa as well as the trust, respect and warm hospitality they have bestowed on you,” he wrote.
The ambassador, however, stressed that the relations between India and Israel were very strong and will survive the “damage” inflicted by Lapid. “As a human being I feel ashamed and want to apologize to our hosts for the bad manner in which we repaid them for their generosity and friendship,” he wrote.
My suggestion. As you vocally did in the past, feel free to use the liberty to sound your criticism of what you dislike in Israel but no need to reflect your frustration on other countries. I’m not sure that you have enough factual basis to make such comparisons. I know I don’t.

Founding member of Democratic Azad Party Salman Nizami called the episode a disgrace.
“India’s biggest film festival and a Cannes award winning jury head calls Vivek’s trashy, vulgar The Kashmir Files out,” he tweeted. “This is what happens when you play with the sentiments of public. Agni[hotri] and [Anupam] Kher made crores, KPs [Kashmiri Pandits are] still fighting for their rights!”
Journalist Rana Ayyub tweeted that what Lapid said should have been called out by Bollywood artists, filmmakers and heads of censor boards.
Political strategist and former Aam Aadmi Party’s social media head Ankit Lal questioned what the supporters of the movie had to say now.
On Monday, Lapid criticised The Kashmir Files in front of an audience that included Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Singh Thakur, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Union Ministers of State L Murugan and Shripad Naik.
The Israeli director said that “all the jury members” were “disturbed and shocked” by Agnihotri’s film, which explores the exodus of Pandits from Kashmir in the 1990s.

The 96-year-old politician died of leukaemia and multiple organ failure in his home city of Shanghai, state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing a letter to the Chinese people by the ruling Communist Party, Parliament, Cabinet and the military announcing the news.
“Comrade Jiang Zemin’s death is an incalculable loss to our party and our military and our people of all ethnic groups,” the letter read.
The heavy crackdown on Tiananmen Square protestors in 1989 had sparked a power struggle at the top of the Communist Party between hard-line reactionaries and reformers. That is when Jiang, a bureaucrat at the time, was elevated to the office of the president. He was seen as the leader who could unify hardliners and more liberal elements of the Communist Party.
Jiang is credited for leading China out of diplomatic isolation that the country faced after the pro-democracy protests. He also worked on improving bilateral relations with the United States.
He is known for successfully reintegrating China back into the international community by overseeing the peaceful handover of Hong Kong from British colonial to a sovereign state in 1997, winning the bid to host the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and joining the World Trade Organization.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183640-wthetdaoge-1669801421.jpg

Adani Group’s acquisition of NDTV stake
On August 23, AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, bought 100% of the equity stakes in Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited, or VCPL, for Rs 113.74 crore.
Later in the month, the Adani Group announced that it will acquire a 29.18% stake in NDTV through VPCL. NDTV had then said that the takeover was done without the consent or any sort of notice served to Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy.
The acquisition was possible as VCPL had given a loan of Rs 403.85 crore to NDTV in 2009. According to the terms of the loan, the company held the right to exercise its warrants and convert the loan amount into equity shares – which it did after being brought by the Adani Group.
In November, the Adani Group, a ports-to-energy conglomerate, decided to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake in NDTV. This will bring the group’s total stake to 55.18%, enough to allow it to take NDTV’s ownership rights.
The offer opened for subscription on November 22 and win continue till December 5.
Meanwhile, NDTV has written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, asking the markets regulator to determine if its 2020 order barring its promoters from making any deals in the securities market restricts the Adani Group from acquiring its shares.",https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/60095-qejayzbuxq-1560528898.jpg

In a interview with the news channel, Gehlot also said there were no chances of Pilot becoming the chief minister if the Congress wins the state Assembly elections next year.

The turmoil was resolved after the Congress formed a three-member panel comprising Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal and Ahmed Patel to address Pilot’s concerns.
Pilot had claimed that he was upset as Gehlot had sidelined him in the state government.
On Thursday, Gehlot dismissed Pilot’s claims and alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party had paid Congress MLAs to stage the revolt.
“Amit Shah was also involved in it, Dharmendra Pradhan was also involved in it,” he said. “All had a meeting [with some of Congress MLAs] in Delhi.”
The chief minister told the news channel that if Pilot was upset with the Congress or him, he should have raised complaints at the party headquarters. He claimed that the Tonk MLA instead went to Manesar in Haryana to meet Union minister and BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan.
The BJP, however, said Gehlot’s claim was baseless.
“The Congress leadership has failed to put their house in order,” BJP Rajasthan unit chief Satish Punia said. “The Congress is losing Rajasthan, that’s why Gehlot is frustrated. Gehlot is blaming BJP for his failure.”
Gehlot also told NDTV that in 2009, he had urged the Congress leadership to make Pilot a Union minister in the United Progressive Alliance government. The chief minister said that he had recommended Pilot’s name as 17 members of the Gurjar community were killed in Rajasthan in a firing incident during the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government.
“Meenas and Gurjars had fought at the time,” he said. “Namo Narain Meena was a minister already in UPA-1...This was UPA-2, and I said he would be minister again. So I said, if you make a Gurjar [Sachin Pilot] a minister, it will at least quell the fight between Gurjars and Meenas.”
‘MLAs protest in September not a revolt’
Gehlot also dismissed that the Congress MLAs protest in September was a revolt.
On September 25, the Congress government in Rajasthan had plunged into another crisis after Gehlot hinted that he would resign as chief minister. The 71-year-old was said to be in fray to be thepresident of the Congress , but later did not contest the polls.
Three senior party leaders – Shanti Dhariwal, Mahesh Joshi and Dharmendra Rathore – had organised a parallel meeting instead of joining the Congress Legislature Party meeting.
Gehlot told NDTV that the MLAs who defied the party were angry with Pilot.
“They were angry because news was spread that Sachin Pilot will be made chief minister,” he told the news channel. “He himself also behaved this way. People thought he is going to be chief minister.”
Gehlot said that MLAs thought the Congress Legislature Party meeting has been called to propose Pilot’s name as the chief minister. When asked if he would be the next chief ministerial candidate, Gehlot said that the top post did not matter to him but that the Congress forms the next government in Rajasthan.
“What is important is that if we conduct a survey... if it emerges our chances are better with me as chief minister, then I am here,” he told NDTV. “If they feel, no, I need to move from the chief minister post, and we need to do some social engineering, based on caste, community or whatever, and only then we will be able to form government, then I have no problem withdrawing from the chief minister post.”
The chief minister also exuded confidence that the Congress will retain the state in the Assembly elections even though Rajasthan has a pattern that the incumbent government gets voted out.
“We can break patterns,” he told the news channel. “It looks like it will change this time, based on the response of the people. I think we would form the government.”
Don’t know who he advising Gehlot against me: Sachin Pilot
Meanwhile, Pilot described the allegations as false and baseless, adding he did not know who was advising the chief minister against him, reported ANI.

Violent protests were triggered in Iran by the death of a 22-year-old Amini in the custody of the morality police in September.
Amini, a Kurdish woman, was detained on September 13 in the Iranian capital of Tehran by the police unit that enforces the country’s obligatory dress codes, including the compulsory wearing of the headscarf in public.
Officials claimed that she died of a heart attack on September 16 while in custody, but critics believe she was physically assaulted on accusations of violating the hijab mandate.
According to the Iran-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 481 protestors, including 68 minors, have been killed as of Thursday.

On Thursday, several countries and human rights groups criticised the hanging of Shekari.
The United States said it was appalled by Shekari’s execution.
“Our message to Iran’s leadership is clear: End this brutal crackdown,” United States Secretary of StateAntony Blinken said. “We will continue to hold the Iranian regime accountable.”
United Kingdom Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he was outraged by the hanging of Shekari.
“The world cannot turn a blind eye to the abhorrent violence committed by the Iranian regime against its own people,” Cleverly said. “The UK is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.”

Hijab mandate in Iran
Since 1983, it has been obligatory for all women in the country to cover their heads in public. The country’s main reformist party, the Union of Islamic Iran People Party, has been calling for the law mandating hijabs to be rescinded.
On December 4, Iran’s Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said that the country’s morality police was being disbanded. However, the interior ministry, which is in charge of the morality police, did not confirm the development.

Meta Oversight Board recommends overhaul of ‘cross-check’ programme,"Dec 07, 2022 · 03:59 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039234/meta-oversight-board-recommends-overhaul-of-cross-check-programme,"Meta’s independent oversight committee on Tuesday recommended that the company should revamp its cross-check system related to the content of high-profile users on Facebook and Instagram.
The cross-check programme, also known as XCheck, exempts accounts of celebrities, politicians and other influential users from its rules. If any post from a user on Meta’s cross-check lists is identified as violating the company’s rules, it remains on the platform until it is further reviewed.
Meta claims the programme provides an additional level of review.
On Tuesday, Meta’s Oversight Board, however, said that it has found several shortcomings in the programme.
“While Meta told the Board that cross-check aims to advance Meta’s human rights commitments, we found that the programme appears more directly structured to satisfy business concerns,” the Board said.
The @OversightBoard urges Meta to prioritize protections for speech that is important from a human rights perspective rather than based on business interests https://t.co/lmtFam0Duq
— Elodie Vialle (@elodievialle) December 6, 2022
The Board added that by providing extra protection to certain users, which it said were mainly selected according to business interests, the programme allows content which would otherwise be removed quickly to remain for a longer period.
“This unequal treatment is particularly concerning given the lack of transparent criteria for Meta’s cross-check lists,” the Board said. “...We are also concerned about the limited information that Meta has provided to the public and its users about cross-check.”
The Board also said that it had started reviewing the cross-check programme in 2021 after a report in the Wall Street Journal alleged it shields “millions of VIP users” from the company’s normal enforcement process.
In one of the examples of how users on the cross-check list benefit from the system, The Wall Street Journal report said that Facebook did not immediately delete posts from Brazilian footballer Neymar that were against the platform’s guidelines for “nonconsensual intimate imagery”.
It was alleged that the footballer had posted nude photos of a woman who had accused him of rape. He had pulled down the images after some time.
In Tuesday’s advisory, Meta’s Oversight Board said that the company should measure, audit and publish key metrics around the cross-check programme to determine its effectiveness.
“Content identified as violating during Meta’s first assessment that is high severity should be removed or hidden while further review is taking place,” the board said while listing out 32 recommendations regarding the programme. “Such content should not be allowed to remain on the platform accruing views simply because the person who posted it is a business partner or celebrity.”
According to Reuters, while the recommendations of the Board are not binding, Meta is required to respond within 60 days.
However, a spokesperson for the Oversight Board said the company had asked for and received an extension of 30 days.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/130173-lhkdusglvn-1572616091.jpg
Centre allows sale of electoral bonds from December 5 to December 12,"Dec 04, 2022 · 03:04 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038995/centre-allows-sale-of-electoral-bonds-from-december-5-to-december-12,"The Centre on Saturday opened a new window for the sale of electoral bonds from December 5 to December 12.
The decision came nearly a month after it had amended the rules of the electoral bonds scheme on November 7 to allow its sale for 15 extra days during the years when elections are due in states and Union Territories.
The Centre then made use of the amendment to open a window for the sale of electoral bonds from November 9 to November 15, ahead of the elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. The announcement made on Saturday also coincides with the second phase of the Gujarat Assembly elections scheduled to be held on December 5.
Electoral bonds are monetary instruments that citizens or corporate groups can buy from a bank and give to a political party, which is then free to redeem for money. The Centre had first introduced electoral bonds in January 2018.
The bonds are available for purchase for a period of 10 days in the months of January, April, July and October. An additional 30 days window is allowed in the years of general elections.
Activists and non-governmental organisations have questioned the transparency of the bonds as no one is required to declare their purchase of these interest-free bonds and political parties do not need to show the source of the money.
However, the government has reasoned that the money is unlikely to be “black” since it has to be given by cheque.
On November 22, Congress leader Jaya Thakur challenged the government’s move to open the additional 15-day window for the sale of electoral bonds in November in the Supreme Court.
A bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices Hima Kohli and JB Pardiwala had said it would hear the petition along with other pending pleas challenging the electoral bond scheme on December 6.
Petitions against the scheme have been filed by two non-governmental organisations – Association for Democratic Reforms and Common Cause. The petitioners questioned why the government introduced the scheme through a Money Bill, thus bypassing the Rajya Sabha.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/113581-dlhovvbemr-1577173742.jpg
"Digital divide: Mobile ownership 30% higher among men than women in India, shows Oxfam report","Dec 05, 2022 · 03:19 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039064/digital-divide-mobile-ownership-30-higher-among-men-than-women-in-india-shows-oxfam-report,"In India, 61% men had a mobile phone, while only 31% women owned one by the end of 2021, non-governmental organisation Oxfam said on Monday in a report on the digital divide in the country.
Citing data from private think tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, Oxfam India said its research showed that access to mobile phones is essential to tackle lack of information among women, strengthen their independent decision-making and provide access to health services.
The report, titled “India Inequality Report 2022: Digital Divide”, also showed that only one-third of internet users in India are women and the country has the widest gender gap of 40.4% within the Asia-Pacific region when it comes to internet access. Indian women are 33% less likely to use mobile internet services than men, according to the report.
“Limited by less expensive and sophisticated handsets, women use a smaller range of digital services (often primarily voice and SMS)” the report noted.
Besides gender, the report also paints a worrying picture of disparity in access to digital devices and services across classifications like caste, wealth and education. The report analysed data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s household survey from January 2018 to December 2021, and also used secondary analysis from the National Sample Survey.
“India’s growing inequality is accentuated due to the digital divide,” Oxfam India Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Behar said. “People without devices and the internet get further marginalised due to difficulties in accessing education, health, and public services.”
Digital divide due to poverty
Among the poorest 20% of Indian households, only 2.7% have access to a computer, while 8.9% have access to the internet, the report showed, citing 2017-’18 data from the National Sample Survey Office. In contrast, 27.6% of the top 20% households have a computer and 50.5% have internet.
Among students too, 41% who belong to the richest 10% section have a computer with internet access, the report said. The share declines to 16% among the next 10% richest students, and to 10% in the third-richest decile.
Among the poorest 10% students, only 2% have a computer that has internet services.
Disparity based on education and employment
The study showed that none of its respondents who have had no education, have a computer, whereas 39% of those with a post-graduate or a PhD degree have one. In the case of mobile phones, only 11% of the uneducated respondents owned a handset, as compared to 76% of those with a post-graduate or a PhD degree.
The report also cited an earlier survey conducted by Oxfam India in 2020, which noted that 75% of Indian parents and 84% of the teachers faced challenges with digital education.
The employment status of Indians also proved to be linked to access to digital services, as 95% of the permanent salaried workers have phones, as compared to only 50% of the unemployed, the report found.
Digital divide vis-a-vis caste
In the case of access to computers, the difference between the general category and Scheduled Tribes was as high as 7 to 8% between 2018 and 2021, the report showed.
The percentage of the population among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with no computers has remained largely similar, but the number of people having no computers within the general and Other Backward Classes increased slightly during the pandemic, according to Oxfam.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183770-ebbkhoezhm-1669985156.jpg

Elizabeth Jones, the United States’ Chargé d’Affaires for India, made the statement while speaking to journalists on Friday.
“We have been discussing this for a long time and will continue to do so,” she said in response to a question about communal statements during elections. “...That’s one of the benefits of this consequential relationship, that we can discuss a great variety of issues – easy issues, difficult issues, issues on which we agree, issues on which we don’t.”
On November 22, a commission in the United States said that religious freedom and the human rights related to it are threatened in India for several reasons, including the government policies failure to protect minorities.
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent American government agency that monitors the universal right to freedom of religion and makes policy suggestions to the White House, had made the statement in a report.
The panel reiterated its recommendation from April that the United States government should designate India as a “country of particular concern” for engaging in or tolerating systematic violations of religious freedom.
Meanwhile, Jones on Friday supported India’s stand on China’s objections to an ongoing Indo-United States military exercise being held in Uttarakhand, PTI reported. To a question on China’s concerns about the exercise, she said: “I think I would point it to the kind of statement that we heard from our Indian colleagues to the effect that it is none of their business.”
On Thursday, the spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi said that the exercise “has got nothing to do with the 1993 and 1996 agreements”.
The agreement from 1993 is to do with maintaining peace along the Line of Actual Control with China, while the one from 1996 pertains to confidence-building measures in the military field.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/140122-icwiawirnl-1587190626.jpg

SVR Srinivas, the chief executive officer of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, said that the conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani submitted a bid of Rs 5,069 crore for the project, while the DLF Group quoted Rs 2,025 crore.
“There were three bidders in total,” Srinivas said. “However, only Adani and DLF were qualified in the final bidding since the other bidder, Naman Group didn’t qualify.” He added that his office will now approach the Maharashtra government to decide the next steps to be taken, and will form a special committee for the project.
The project will entail the rehabilitation of 6.5 lakh slum residents who currently live in an area spread over 2.5 square kilometres. It will involve the redevelopment of buildings and informal tenements, as well as the development of infrastructure such as water supply and sewage in Dharavi, considered to be among the world’s largest slums.
The Adani Group, along with the state government’s Slum Rehabilitation Authority, will need to create a special purpose vehicle to execute the project. The project is expected to be completed in seven years, Srinivas said, according to PTI.
In October, eight entities, including those based in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, had attended a pre-bid meeting. However, only three of them – the Adani Group, DLF and Mumbai-based realty firm Naman Developers – had actually bid for the project.
In October 2020, the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi government had cancelled the bidding process for the project, citing challenges in the acquisition of railway land.
But in September, the newly-formed state government led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde allowed fresh tenders for the project.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/139721-lhigujmbkj-1603461626.jpg

It was leading in the last seat at 9.45 pm.
The Congress has been reduced to just 17 seats from the 77 it won in the 2017 Assembly elections. The Aam Aadmi Party bagged five constituencies, enabling it to claim the status of a national party.
The BJP’s performance on Thursday eclipsed the Congress’ best results, when it had won 149 seats in 1985. The BJP had first secured a clear majority in the state in 1995, winning 121 seats, and has won every Assembly election in the state since then.
However, its best showing was in 2002, when the saffron party won 127 seats in the aftermath of the communal riots that had broken out in the state in February that year. This was also the first election in which Narendra Modi was seeking a full term as chief minister.
He had succeeded Keshubhai Patel in 2001, who had resigned mid-term.

However, as the counting of votes started at 8 am on Thursday, the BJP went on to shatter all previous records. At 8.45 pm, the saffron party had won 52.5% of the vote share, while the Congress secured 27.3%.

Mishra has been charged for a number of offences including murder, attempt to murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy. The trial will begin on December 16.
Eight persons, including four farmers, were killed on October 3 after violence broke in the Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh during a protest against the Centre’s agricultural laws that have now been repealed. Farmer bodies had alleged that a vehicle belonging to Ashish Mishra had run over a group of demonstrators.
Mishra was first arrested in the case on October 9. He walked out of jail on February 15 after the Allahabad High Court granted him bail on February 10.
However, families of those killed in the violence challenged the bail order in the Supreme Court, which overturned the High Court verdict and cancelled Mishra’s bail on April 18. He is currently lodged in Lakhimpur prison.
On Monday, a district court in Lakhimpur Kheri had rejected discharge applications filed by him and other accused persons, reported Live Law.
On Tuesday, the court said that the Ashish Mishra and 13 others will be tried under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons), 427 (mischief causing damage), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act.

Shah on Thursday said that he often hears that history has been presented wrongly and in a distorted manner. “This may be true, but who is stopping us now from writing history in a way that reflects its glory?” he asked.
The home minister urged historians and students to “identify 30 great empires in Indian history and 300 warriors who showed exemplary valour to protect the motherland” and write about them extensively. “A new history will emerge, and the lies will vanish on their own,” he said.
Shah said that the Centre is willing to “support any task undertaken for the glory of the country”.
He made the statements at an event in New Delhi to commemorate the 400th birth anniversary of Ahom commander Lachit Borphukan. The 17th-century commander was best known for his leadership in the Battle of Saraighat of 1671, during which the Ahom army defeated Mughal forces and compelled them to retreat from Guwahati.

Shah said that while the Mughal forces were numerically superior to the Ahom army and were better equipped, the Mughals “did not even have a trace of the patriotism that Borphukan and his soldiers had”.

There are 18.64 lakh UK residents who chose Indian as their ethnicity under the Asian category. This means that the number of persons of Indian origin in the UK has increased to 3.1% of the total population from 2.5% (14.12 lakh) recorded in the 2011 census.
Persons of Indian origin were also the largest among the Asian category, the data showed. Persons of Pakistani origin took the second spot with 15.87 lakh residents in Britain. Their population increased by 0.7% since the 2011 census.
The number of persons of Chinese origin grew at par with the country’s population. The percentage of their population remained constant at 0.7% from 2011 to 2021, rising from 3.93 lakh to 4.45 lakh.
The UK population (England and Wales) stood at 5.95 crore, increasing by 6.3% since the last census when it was 5.60 crore.
Meanwhile, while the number of White residents in the country rose from 4.87 crore to 4.82 crore – their percentage in the total population dropped from 86% in 2011 to 81.7% in 2021.
In the White ethnic group, 4.43 crore identified as English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. More than 36.67 lakh persons chose the “other White” category.
Christians now less than half the population
Meanwhile, the census data showed that for the first time, less than half of the population identified as Christians. The number of Christians in 2021 stood at 2.75 crore, or 46.2% of the population, dropping from 3.32 crore, or 59.3%, in 2011.
This data is based on the answers given by 94% of the country’s population as responding to the questions about religion was voluntary.
At the same time, the number of residents opting for the “no religion” option, the second-most common response, increased to 2.21 crore, or 37.2% of the population, in 2021 from 1.41 crore, or 25.2%, as of 2011.
The number of Muslims increased to 38.68 lakh (6.5% of the population) from 27.20 lakh (4.9%) in 2011. The population of Hindus also increased to 10.32 lakh (1.7%) from 8.17 (1.5%) since the last census.
We’ve released new #Census2021 data on religion in England and Wales.

46.2% said they were “Christian” – less than half of the population for the first time.

This was a decrease from 59.3% in 2011, but still the most common response.

The petitioners contended that according to a letter issued by the Delimitation Commission in July 2004, the number of existing Assembly seats of all states and Union Territories cannot not be changed till the first Census is conducted after 2026.
They have also argued that under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019, the Election Commission was the only body empowered to conduct the delimitation exercise.
In February 2020, the Union government had started the delimitation process – or redrawing boundaries – of Assembly constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir. On May 5, the number of Assembly seats was increased from 83 to 90 in the final delimitation order.
Of the seven new seats, one was given to Kashmir, taking its total to 46, and six were given to Jammu, which now has 43 seats.
While it is a routine effort in some parts of the country, the delimitation process is much more politically sensitive in Jammu and Kashmir because of fears that the Bharatiya Janata Party may use it to alter political outcomes in what was earlier India’s only Muslim-majority state.
At Thursday’s hearing, Mehta told the court that the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019 gives the power to carry out a delimitation exercise to the commission, reported The Indian Express.
“By virtue of Sections 60-61 [of the 2019 Act], while the power to determine delimitation is conferred on Election Commission, Section 62(2) and 62(3) confers powers to carry out delimitation on the Delimitation Commission constituted under Section 3 of Delimitation Act,” he said.
Mehta also told the court that all procedural compliances were met while carrying out the exercise, reported the Hindustan Times. “The first delimitation is to be done by the delimitation commission and then it can be done by Election Commission,” he added.
The court has reserved its verdict on the matter.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183814-vicaxfhhrt-1670067102.jpg
"Collegium system of appointing judges is law of land and must be adhered to, SC tells Centre","Dec 08, 2022 · 04:42 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1039324/collegium-system-of-appointing-judges-is-law-of-land-and-must-be-adhered-to-sc-tells-centre,"The Supreme Court on Thursday told the Centre that the collegium system of appointing judges to the higher judiciary is the law of the land and must be adhered to, Live Law reported.
“There are sections in society who do not agree with the laws made by the Parliament,” a bench led by Justice SK Kaul told Attorney General R Venkataramani. “Should the court stop enforcing such laws on that ground? If everyone in society decides which law to follow and which law to not follow, there would be a breakdown.”
The remarks by the bench come a day after Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar criticised in the Rajya Sabha the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015.
The law had proposed to make judicial appointments through a body comprising of the chief justice, two senior Supreme Court judges, the law minister and two other eminent persons nominated by the chief justice, the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition.
The proposed law was to replace the collegium system, under which five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, decide on the appointments and transfers of judges to the top court and the High Courts.
The comments by the bench also came amid a renewed rift between the Union government and the Supreme Court over the appointment of judges.
Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju had told the news channel Times Now on November 26 that the collegium system is not in consonance with the Constitution. Two days later, the Supreme Court had objected to the statement.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court reiterated that comments against the judiciary by government functionaries are not well taken, Bar and Bench reported.
“You have to advise them Attorney General [Venkataramani],” the bench, also comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Vikram Nath said. “Any law declared by this court is binding on all the stakeholders.
The bench also noted that the Centre recently send back 19 names, including 10 names reiterated by the Supreme Court collegium, reported Live Law.
“Sometimes the names are approved fast and some others are kept pending for months,” the bench said. “How will this ping-pong battle last?”
It further added: “We expect the Attorney General to play the role of the senior most law officer in advising the Government of the legal position.”

Iran abolishes morality police after huge anti-hijab protests,"Dec 04, 2022 · 02:11 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038990/iran-to-review-mandatory-hijab-law-for-women,"Iran on Sunday abolished its morality police force months after widespread protests erupted in the country following the death of Mahsa Amini in custody, who had been held for allegedly violating the rule for women to wear a hijab, AFP reported.
“Morality police have nothing to do with judiciary,” Iranian Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said on Sunday, according to AFP.
The decision to do away with the morality police came after the Iranian authorities said on Saturday that they will review the law that requires all women to cover their heads in public.
“Both parliament and the judiciary are working [on the matter]” had said, adding that a review team met the parliament’s cultural commission to discuss the subject on Wednesday.
The statement came two-and-a-half months after violent protests erupted in Iran triggered by the death of a 22-year-old Amini in custody of the morality police .
Amini, a Kurdish woman, had been detained on September 13 in the Iranian capital of Tehran by the police unit that enforces the country’s obligatory dress codes, including the compulsory wearing of the headscarf in public.
Officials said she died of heart attack on September 16 while in custody but critics believe she was physically assaulted on accusations of violating the hijab mandate.
The state security council of Iran’s interior ministry said that 200 persons have died in the protests, Reuters reported. Amirali Hajizadeh, a commander of the country’s Revolutionary Guards, said that 300 persons, including security officials, have been killed in the violence.
On Saturday, President Ebrahim Raisi said that the country’s republican and Islamic foundations were entrenched in the constitution. “But there are methods of implementing the constitution that can be flexible,” he said.
Since 1983, it has been obligatory for all women in Iran to cover their heads in public. The country’s main reformist party, the Union of Islamic Iran People Party, has been calling for the law mandating hijabs to be rescinded.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/118305-uukkolqnrq-1556177591.jpg
Akhilesh Yadav demands re-polling in Rampur seat alleging election malpractice,Yesterday · 12:01 pm,https://scroll.in/latest/1039368/akhilesh-yadav-demands-re-polling-in-rampur-seat-alleging-election-malpractice,"After his party candidate lost the bye-polls in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur Assembly constituency on Thursday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has demanded that the Election Commission should conduct a re-polling, NDTV reported.
During the polling on Monday, the party had alleged that the police and administration were allowing its supporters to vote. A low voter turnout of 33% was recorded in Rampur.
The results declared on Thursday showed that Samajwadi Party candidate Mohammed Asim Raja, who was backed by convicted party MLA Azam Khan, had lost to Akash Saxena from the Bharatiaya Janata Party. The BJP has won the seat for the first time.
Rampur has been a stronghold of Khan, whose conviction in a 2019 hate speech case necessitated the bye-elections. He was disqualified as an MLA after the conviction.
On Friday, Yadav told NDTV in an interview that despite repeated complaints, the Election Commission did not take action against the Rampur administration.
“Who should we put our faith on, if the Election Commission is not going to look into all this?” he told the news channel. “The administration insulted out supporters. Some were even manhandled and prevented from voting.”
The Uttar Pradesh government and the Rampur district administration have denied the allegations saying the by-elections were free and fair.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/164883-vlsfftwatf-1633623575.jpeg

The Ramon Magasaysay Award-winning news anchor used to host the programmes Hum Log, Ravish Ki Report, Desh Ki Baat and Prime Time.
NDTV said that his resignation was effective immediately. “Few journalists have impacted people as much as Ravish,” the mail stated. “This reflects in the immense feedback about him: in the crowds he draws everywhere; in the prestigious awards and recognition he has received, within India and internationally; and in his daily reports, which champion the rights and needs of those who are under-served.”
In September 2019, Kumar won the Ramon Magsaysay Award for “harnessing journalism to give voice to the voiceless”.
The Ramon Magasaysay Foundation said that Kumar was being recognised for “his unfaltering commitment to a professional, ethical journalism of the highest standards; his moral courage in standing up for truth, integrity, and independence; and his principled belief that it is in giving full and respectful voice to the voiceless, in speaking truth bravely yet soberly to power, that journalism fulfills its noblest aims to advance democracy”.
The announcement about Kumar’s resignation came a day after the news channel informed the Bombay Stock Exchange in a regulatory filing that its founders Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy have resigned as the directors of RRPR Holding Private Limited.
RRPR, or Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Private Limited, is the promoter company of NDTV. It holds a 29.18% stake in the news channel that is being taken over by the Adani Group.
On August 23, AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, bought 100% of the equity stakes in Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited, or VCPL, for Rs 113.74 crore.
Later that month, the Adani Group announced that it will acquire a 29.18% stake in NDTV through VPCL. NDTV had then said that the takeover was done without the consent or any sort of notice served to Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy.
In November, the Adani Group, a ports-to-energy conglomerate, decided to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake in NDTV. This will bring the group’s total stake to 55.18%, enough to allow it to take NDTV’s ownership rights.

The protest took a violent turn on Saturday after demonstrators prevented the Adani Group from resuming construction at the project site, which has been suspended for the last four months. The construction at the port was resumed on the directions of the Kerala High Court.
On Sunday, a first information report was registered against Thiruvananthapuram Archbishop Thomas Netto, Auxiliary Bishop R Kristudas and 13 other Latin Catholic priests in connection with Saturday’s violence.

Hijab controversy in Karnataka
A controversy erupted in the southern state in December last year after a group of Muslim students of the Government Women’s Pre-University College in Udupi city were not allowed to attend classes for being dressed in hijab. The students staged a protest, and similar demonstrations were held in other parts of Karnataka.
Hindu students and mobs of men protested against Muslim women wearing hijabs to educational institutes. At some colleges, Muslim students were heckled, while in another case, some men climbed up a flagpole to plant a saffron flag and broke into classrooms.
In February, the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state issued an order banning clothes in educational institutes which “disturb equality, integrity and public order”. The order was challenged in the court, but the Karnataka High Court, on March 15, upheld the ban observing that the hijab was not an essential part of Islam and thus could not be protected under the fundamental right to religion.
The petitioners then moved the Supreme Court challenging the High Court order.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1.65 lakh each on the two convicts, Umesh and Udayakumar.
The decomposed body of the 32-year-old woman was found in April 2018 in a mangrove forest near the city of Kovalam, almost a month after she was reported missing. The woman, her partner and her sister were in India to undergo ayurvedic treatment at a facility near Thiruvananthapuram.
A month after her body was found, the police arrested Umesh and Udayakumar, alleging that they drugged the woman before raping and murdering her. The police said that the two men were habitual offenders who have been involved in multiple narcotics and assault-related cases.
After the ruling on Tuesday, the convicts demanded that a lie detector test should be conducted to allow them to prove their innocence, reported The News Minute. They also claimed that they had seen a yoga guru running away from the crime spot on the day the Latvian woman was murdered. They alleged that the police did not investigate strands of hair that were found near the dead body.
Assistant Commissioner of Police JK Dinil, however, told the court that the officials had ruled out the allegations during the investigation, reported The New Indian Express.
The case had received media attention after the sister of the murdered woman, started to track her down, according to The Indian Express. Besides registering a police complaint, she also visited several locations and homes to trace her sister, put up posters and announced a reward for information about her.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/108755-yociyfeesj-1605874454.jpg

The Supreme Court had acquitted the three men – Ravi Kumar, Rahul and Vinod – on November 7. All three had been sentenced to death by a trial court in February 2014, and the verdict had been upheld by the Delhi High Court in August 2014.
The woman’s body was mutilated body and found three days after she was abducted in Delhi in February 2012. According to the police, one of the accused men had committed the crime to take revenge after she had turned down his proposal.
The parents of the woman, in the review petition against the acquittal, claimed that many crucial facts had not been brought to the Supreme Court’s attention. They also contended that DNA proof and evidence from the test identification parade of the accused persons had been wrongly interpreted by the Supreme Court, India Today reported.
The petition said that the mobile phone location of one of the men – and blood stains on his clothes – proved his involvement in the crime.
Last month, Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena had approved the filing of the review petition.
The Supreme Court, while acquitting the accused men, had said that the prosecution was unable to prove its case with respect to the arrest of the men, their identification and the recovery of incriminating material.
The court had said that no test identification parade had been carried out during the investigation and that a witness had not identified the accused persons.
“Every case has to be decided by the Courts strictly on merits and in accordance with law without being influenced by any kind of outside moral pressures,” a bench headed by former Chief Justice of India UU Lalit had said.

Chhattisgarh Assembly passes two Bills for increasing reservation to 76% in state,"Dec 03, 2022 · 09:55 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038923/chhattisgarh-assembly-passes-two-bills-for-increasing-reservation-to-76-in-state,"The Chhattisgarh Assembly on Friday adopted two Bills to enhance the state’s reservation to 76% in jobs and educational institutions, PTI reported.
Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel tabled the Chhattisgarh Public Service (Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes Reservation) Amendment Bill and Chhattisgarh Educational Institutions (Reservation in admission) Amendment Bill, which were passed after a debate of more than five hours.
As per the Bills, 32% of the seats will be reserved for Scheduled Tribes, 13% for Scheduled Castes and 4% for Economically Weaker Sections, ANI reported.
After the Bill was announced, Baghel told mediapersons that the previous Bharatiya Janata Party ministers could not form a Quantifiable Data Commission, which was constituted by his government in 2019 to survey people from Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Section categories in the state, PTI reported.
The commission submitted its recommendations to the state government, according to which the state’s population has 42.41% Other Backward Class members and 3.48% from the Economically Weaker Sections.
Leader of Opposition Narayan Chandel and other MLAs said the Quantifiable Data Commission report was not tabled in the Assembly.
BJP members also pointed out that the party had brought amendment proposals to the Bills seeking 16% reservation for the Scheduled Caste category.
In response, Baghel said that the Census has not been carried out in the country since 2011, and reservations for Scheduled Castes can be amended accordingly when the exercise is done.
In September, the Chhattisgarh High Court had set aside a 2012 state government order to raise quota to 58% in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions. The High Court had said reservation exceeding the 50% was unconstitutional.
According to the 2012 amendment, the quota for Scheduled Castes was slashed by 4% to 12%, while quota for Scheduled Tribes was increased by 12% to 32%.
The reservation for Other Backward Classes was retained at 14%.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181578-shtdozhele-1666266434.jpg

Jakhar had joined the BJP in July. He had quit the Congress on May 14, saying that the party was facing an existential crisis. The Congress had removed Jakhar from all posts on April 26 accusing him of being involved in activities against the party.
Singh had joined the BJP in September. He had also announced the merger of his outfit, the Punjab Lok Congress, with the BJP.
The Punjab Lok Congress was founded in November 2021 after Singh had resigned as the chief minister and quit the Congress in September following a tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu.
Meanwhile, Shergill had resigned from the Congress in August. In a letter to former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Shergill had said that the ideology and the vision of the current decision-makers of the Congress were no longer in sync with the aspirations of the youth and modern India.
He had also accused the Congress of not taking the interests of the public and the country and being influenced by the “self-serving interests of individuals indulging in sycophancy and consistently ignoring on-ground reality”.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183211-dzhfcamakw-1669106019.jpg

The vacancies were later put under the Economically Weaker Section category after the Supreme Court in May last year, struck down the provisions for Maratha reservation under the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The court had held that the provision breached the ceiling of 50% quota limit imposed in the 1992 Indra Sawhney landmark verdict.
After the judgement, the Maharashtra government had extended the Economically Weaker Section quota to the 111 Maratha community candidates who had applied under the 2018 law.
A total of 1,143 candidates had been selected by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. In its Thursday order, the High Court allowed the state government to appoint all other candidates other than the 111 Maratha applicants.
On November 29, the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal had granted interim relief to the 111 candidates, saying that the state government can make the appointments, but they would be subject to its final decision on the case.
This order was challenged before the High Court.
On Thursday, the High Court said that complications would arise if appointments are made when the tribunal has fixed December 2 as the final date for hearing.
“Although we normally refrain from interfering with the business of tribunals with respect to the pending pleas before it, but having regard to the importance of the issues before it, we urge the tribunal to consider the application before the end of January, 2023,” a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Abhay Ahuja said.
It said that if the tribunal rules in favour of the 111 candidates, their seniority would be determined on the basis of the of appointment date which is December 1.
The petition before the High Court was filed by person named AM Havshette and two others who belong to the EWS category, reported The Times of India.
The petitioners had told the High Court that their appointment would be prejudiced as the state was allowing the candidates from the Socially and Economically Backward Classes to change the quota category to EWS.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183372-opdpoiobzn-1669347423.jpg

Poonawala had been taken to the laboratory to undergo a polygraph test as part of the police’s investigation into the case. The police said that some earlier sessions of the test were not satisfactory as he was unwell.
Poonawala was arrested on November 12 after the police said that he confessed to killing Walkar and chopping her body into several pieces. He then threw the body parts at various places in Delhi over several days, the police said.

A notice banning the entry of women, whether alone or in groups, was removed from gate number 3 of the mosque. However, the Jama Masjid’s public relations officer Sabiullah Khan maintained that persons visiting the mosque will need to “maintain purity” there.
“There has been a ruckus since the news of the ban on the entry of girls, but in the midst of this, [Lieutenant Governor] VK Saxena spoke to the Shahi Imam and also asked to withdraw the decision” Khan said. “After this, the board has also been removed.”
Earlier on Thursday, the mosque banned women after some incidents of “wrong things” were allegedly reported from the premises.
“Jama Masjid is a place of worship and people are welcome for that,” said mosque’s Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari said. “But girls coming alone and waiting for their dates... this is not what this place is meant for. The restriction is on that.”
However, the National Commission for Women had objected to the notice and asked the Centre and the Delhi government to take action against it. The chief of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal described the ban as a violation of women’s rights and sought a report on it by November 28.
“Preventing women to freely enter and practice their religion in the mosque is highly discriminatory and an extreme regressive practice as a place of worship should be open to everyone regardless of their gender,” a notice from the Delhi women’s panel said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/162300-lxsmdtzhuv-1643965145.jpg
J&K: Over 11 lakh new voters added to electoral rolls – the highest ever,"Nov 26, 2022 · 10:36 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038372/j-k-over-11-lakh-new-voters-added-to-electoral-rolls-the-highest-ever,"The final electoral rolls of Jammu and Kashmir were published on Friday, with the addition of more than 11 lakh new voters – the highest ever, PTI reported, citing officials. Taking into account the names that were deleted from the voters’ list, the net increase of electors stood at 7,72,872, they said.
There are a total of 83,59,771 voters in the new electoral rolls of Jammu and Kashmir, joint chief electoral officer of the Union Territory Anil Salgotra told PTI.
The preparation of the electoral rolls is a step forward towards holding Assembly polls in the Union Territory – the first since the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was abrogated in August 2019.
The erstwhile state had also been bifurcated into two Union Territories after the abrogation.
The revision of electoral rolls in Jammu and Kashmir holds significance as the exercise was carried out for the first time since the abrogation of its special status. Until August 2019, voting rights were restricted to those defined as permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir.
Leaders of Kashmiri political parties have expressed apprehensions that the revision of electoral rolls could be an attempt to alter the demographics of the Union Territory. Former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has described the move as the first step towards the Centre’s “colonial settler project” in the region.

In February 2020, the Union government had started the delimitation process – or redrawing boundaries – of Assembly constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir. On May 5, the number of Assembly seats was increased from 83 to 90 in the final delimitation order.
Of the seven new seats, one was given to Kashmir, taking its total to 46, and six were given to Jammu, which now has 43 seats.
While it is a routine effort in some parts of the country, the delimitation process is much more politically sensitive in Jammu and Kashmir because of fears that the Bharatiya Janata Party may use it to alter political outcomes in what was earlier India’s only Muslim-majority state.
In June, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had said elections in Jammu and Kashmir could be held by the end of this year. However, it seems unlikely as the Election Commission has not issued any notification yet.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/168147-nijahvyfum-1640765957.jpg

Last week, members of the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association had staged a protest and decided to abstain from work on November 17 after the collegium proposed to transfer Kariel to the Patna High Court.
“Justice Kariel is one of the finest, honest, upright and unbiased Judge whose integrity and honesty is being vouched by the entire Bar in one voice,” the association had said in a resolution.
Lawyers in Telangana and Madras High Courts had also joined the protest against the proposed transfer of Justice Abhishek Reddy of the Telangana High Court to the Patna High Court, and acting Chief Justice T Raja of the Madras High Court to the Rajasthan High Court.

"Centre holding back crucial documents related to demonetisation, P Chidambaram tells Supreme Court","Nov 24, 2022 · 06:42 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038271/centre-holding-back-crucial-documents-related-to-demonetisation-p-chidambaram-tells-supreme-court,"The Centre is holding back crucial documents related to the move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016, Congress MP P Chidambaram told the Supreme Court on Thursday, while appearing as a counsel for one of the petitioners who have challenged the move, Live Law reported.
“We still do not have the November 7 [2016] letter from the Centre to the Reserve Bank of India, the agenda note placed before the Central Board of the Reserve Bank, the minutes of the Central Board meeting and their recommendations, and the actual Cabinet decision on November 8,” Chidambaram said. “These documents have not yet been placed in the public domain, despite the passage of six years.”
Chidambaram made the submission before a Constitution bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna, V Ramasubramanian and BV Nagarathna. The bench is hearing a batch of 58 petitions challenging the demonetisation move.
On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease to be legal tender in India from midnight. Modi had said that the decision had been taken to “fight corruption, black money and terrorism”.
The Rs 2,000 notes and Rs 500 notes with a new design were introduced after demonetisation.
The petitioners have claimed that the exercise violated several constitutional rights of citizens, such as the right to property (Article 300A), right to equality (Article 14), right to carry on any trade, business or occupation (Article 19) and right to life and right to livelihood (Article 21).
At Thursday’s hearing, Chidambaram alleged that neither the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India, nor the Union Cabinet had all the information regarding the move.
“No one was told that 86% of the total currency would be withdrawn,” Chidambaram told the Supreme Court, according to Live Law. “This is not a guess, but an informed guess.”
Noting that exercise to demonetise the currencies was “deeply flawed”, Chidambaram told the court that according to his calculation, the entire exercise was done in 26 hours.
“This is the most outrageous decision-making process which makes a mockery of the rule of law,” he added.
At an earlier hearing on November 17, the central government had told the Supreme Court that demonetisation was a “well-considered decision” taken after advance preparation and consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.
“All possible measures were taken to mitigate inconvenience to the public and reduce the disruption of economic activities,” the government had said in an affidavit. “The short-term inconvenience and disruptions have to be seen in the larger context.”",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/172758-zdibuwjrjp-1649410838.jpg
White House says it is working on lowering visa waiting period for Indians,Yesterday · 03:35 pm,https://scroll.in/latest/1039388/white-house-says-it-is-working-on-lowering-visa-waiting-period-for-indians,"The White House said on Thursday that it is working on resolving the significant visa wait time period in India and other countries. Last month, the appointment wait time for Indians seeking a visitor or a tourist visa for the United States reached over 900 days.
“We are successfully lowering visa interview wait times – that’s around the world,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in response to a question about the waiting time for Indian citizens. “And we’ve doubled our hiring of US foreign service personnel to do this important work.”
The visa processing is recovering faster than projected and it is expected to reach pre-pandemic processing levels, said the White House.
The waiting period of over 900 days is for those Indians seeking a B1 (Business) or a B2 (Tourist) category visa to visit the United States. Those seeking the visa appointment at the US Embassy in New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai are expected to wait 999 days, according to the US State Department website.
The advisory commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, also recommended that United States President Joe Biden should consider issuing a memo to the State Department to reduce the visa appointment wait time to a maximum of two to four weeks for countries like India with significant backlogs, reported PTI.
During its meeting this week, the President’s Advisory Commission recommended reducing the growing delay in visa appointment times in US embassies globally especially in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and other countries.
Last month, the US Department of State had said that many applicants for visas are required to appear in person under the country’s law, which was not possible during local pandemic-era restrictions on public places. This created a backlog of visa applications, thus increasing the waiting period, it said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183302-ympssnegbn-1669215533.jpg

The action against Inamul Rahman, who had been serving as principal of New Government Law College since 2019, was taken after a controversy erupted in the college about a book in the institute’s library.
Members of student Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, or ABVP, had alleged that the book Collective Violence and Criminal Justice System contains objectionable content against Hindus and Hindutva outfits such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal.
ABVP is the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
ABVP members alleged that the book talks about the emergence of “Hindu communalism as a destructive ideology”. The book also mentions that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindutva outfits seek to establish a Hindu-majority state and want to “enslave other communities”, ABVP claimed, according to NDTV.
On December 1, members of the organisation had also accused some professors of the college of promoting “love jihad” and “propagating religious extremism”. The professors were temporarily suspended from carrying out academic work as the college authorities decided to get a retired district court judge to investigate the allegations.
“Love jihad” is a conspiracy theory espoused by Hindutva activists, who claim that it involves Muslim men luring Hindu women to marry them in order to later convert them to Islam. The term is being used despite the BJP-led Centre’s statement in Lok Sabha in February 2020 that no “case of ‘love jihad’ has been reported by any of the central agencies”.
On Saturday, Madhya Home Minister Narottam Mishra ordered the police to register a case after conducting an inquiry into the contents of the book.
“We have received complaints of professors teaching out-of-syllabus texts. Anti-national issues have surfaced,” Mishra said, according to NDTV. “Complaints such as getting students to cast their votes on Article 370 and issues of ‘love jihad’ have also surfaced. We will take strict action.”
Following this, a first information report was registered against Rahman, the author of the book, Farhat Khan, the book’s publisher Amar Law Publication and professor Mirza Mojiz Baig.
They have been charged under Sections 153-A (promoting enmity amongst two groups), 295-A (making deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage the religious feeling of a group), 500 (defamation), 504 (intentional insult with an intent to provoke and breach peace), 505 (statements conducting to public mischief), and other sections of the Indian Penal Code.
The FIR was based on a complaint filed by a student Lucky Adiwal, who allegedly had not paid his fee for the past two years, reported The Indian Express, citing college authorities.
“Resigned under pressure”
On Saturday, Rahman claimed that when he took charge in 2019, he was not aware that the college library had the book.
“I had to resign under pressure with no fault of mine,” he told The Indian Express. “The book was procured by the principal in 2014 based on the recommendation of the faculty.”
He added: “After objections were raised over the content of the book back then, the writer had to apologise and the book was never a part of the curriculum since.”
Meanwhile, Hitesh Khetrapal, a representative of Amar Law Publications said that the content in some pages of the book were edited in 2021.
“The first edition of this book was published in the year 2015,” Khetrapa said, according to PTI. “When we came to know about its controversial parts in 2021, we discussed it with its author and got the related pages of the book changed.”
Khetrapal also said that a letter of apology was also submitted by Khan at the time.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/127497-grdfcvqgzy-1584445216.jpg
NHRC seeks preventive measures after violence on Assam-Meghalaya border,"Nov 29, 2022 · 06:14 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038597/nhrc-seeks-preventive-measures-after-violence-on-assam-meghalaya-border,"The National Human Rights Commission on Tuesday told the Centre and the Assam government to suggest measures to prevent a recurrence of the police firing along the state’s border with Meghalaya last week.
On November 22, five residents of Meghalaya and an official of the Assam Forest Guard were killed as the Assam Police opened fire after an altercation. The two states give conflicting versions of the incident, including where it took place.
According to Assam, the firing happened in West Karbi Anglong district’s “Mukhrow” village. Meghalaya claims the same place as “Mukroh” village, part of its West Jaintia Hills district.
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma filed a memorandum with the National Human Rights Commission in connection with the incident.
The human rights body said on Tuesday that it has sought a response from the Union home secretary and the chief secretary of Assam to suggest mechanisms to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, particularly in areas that are the subject of border disputes between neighbouring states. The panel has directed the officials to submit their responses within two weeks.
“Whatsoever may be the dispute between the states, police has to use restrain in such situations,” the National Human Rights Commission said. “Therefore, it would want to get examined the standard operating procedure in operation, if any, about firing by Armed Forces/Police in areas of a border dispute between neighbouring states.”
On November 23, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the firing appeared to have been unprovoked, but claimed that the incident was not related to the border dispute. “The firing was a fall-out of the clash between locals of Meghalaya and forest and police personnel of Assam and not a border clash,” he said.
Territorial disputes between the two states had begun when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam on January 21, 1972, under the Assam Reorganisation Act, 1971. Disputes arose after Meghalaya had challenged the law.
Meanwhile, Sangma on Tuesday said that the second round of talks between Assam and Meghalaya for resolving the border dispute has become slightly complicated following last week’s violence, reported PTI.
Assam and Meghalaya have identified 12 disputed areas along the interstate border. The two states started the first round of discussions in July 2021 and signed a memorandum of understanding in March this year to resolve differences in six areas.
“The situation [for border talks] is slightly complicated and we may not be able to go forward immediately. It could get delayed,” Sangma said, reported PTI. “We strongly feel this [holding talks] is the way to move forward in resolving differences along the interstate border.”
The process for the second phase of talks to resolve differences in the remaining six disputed areas, including Block-I in West Jaintia Hills district, Block-II in Ri-Bhoi and Langpih in West Khasi, was initiated with the setting up of regional committees, reported the news agency.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/144876-ndzdlodpdf-1640196722.jpg

A bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha remarked that such petitions were turning the system dysfunctional.
“Every evil you see does not merit a PIL,” Chief Justice Chandrachud said. “Your panacea does not warrant a remedy. Try getting judges to fill up the existing vacancies and then you will realise how difficult it is.”
The court said that “populist measures” and “simplistic solutions” were not likely to solve such problems, according to Live Law.
“Getting more judges is not the panacea of all evils,” the bench said. “We cannot entertain petitions which are general like this.”
Upadhyay said that he had filed the petition in public interest, and that the litigation was not meant to be an adversarial one. However, the court refused to accept the contention.
“This is like Parliament saying in an Act that all matters will be disposed of within six months,” Chief Justice Chandrachud said. “It does not happen like this.”
Upadhyay subsequently agreed to withdraw the petition. “Liberty granted to file a fresh plea if any with research on statistics on recruitment, vacancies etc,” the court said in its order.
The Supreme Court is currently hearing a contempt petition by the Advocates Association Bengaluru against the Union law ministry for not approving 11 names given by the Supreme Court collegium. On Monday, a bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and AS Oka objected to remarks by Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju about the collegium system of appointing judges to the higher judiciary.
The court had asked why the government was not clearing names recommended by the collegium for judicial appointments.
The law minister had said that the collegium system is not in consonance with the Constitution. “You tell me under which provision the collegium system has been prescribed,” he had said while speaking to news channel Times Now on November 26. Rijiju added that the collegium cannot expect the government to simply accept all the recommendations it makes.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183430-oawstvysms-1669441799.jpg
‘Set your house in order’: Supreme Court says Army not being fair to women officers,7 hours ago,https://scroll.in/latest/1039443/set-your-house-in-order-supreme-court-says-army-not-being-fair-to-women-officers,"The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Indian Army to set its “house in order”, noting that it had not been fair to women officers who have alleged that they were not being considered for promotions, PTI reported.
A bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha made the comment while hearing a petition filed by 34 women Army officers. The petitioners claimed that junior male officers were being considered over them for promotions to carry out “combat and commanding roles”.
The court directed the Army not to declare the results for male officers who had been considered for promotions in October till it announces the results for the female officers.
“We feel that you (Army) have not been fair to these women officers,” the court said. “You better set your house in order and tell us what you are doing for them.”
The bench directed Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, who represented the Centre, and Senior Advocate R Balasubramanian, the Army, to state why the petitioners had not been considered from promotions in October.
Jain told the court that measures would be taken to accommodate the promotion of women officers, India Today reported. “We are committed to the cause of women officers,” he said.
Senior advocate V Mohana, appearing for the petitioners, said that since the Supreme Court judgement that directed the Army to grant permanent commission to women, about 1,200 junior male officers had been promoted.
In a landmark verdict in February 2020, the Supreme Court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission. The court had rejected the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.
The Army had constituted a special selection board in September 2020 to screen women officers. The results were declared a month later. After this, some women who were not granted a permanent commission had moved the Supreme Court.
In response to their petition, the Supreme Court had held that the evaluation criteria for granting permanent commission to women officers systematically discriminated against them. The court had also ordered a review of the method of evaluation for future batches.",https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/124798-wnchdazryr-1576491386.jpg
"Assam Police firing violated human rights, says Meghalaya chief minister","Nov 26, 2022 · 11:43 am",https://scroll.in/latest/1038376/assam-police-firing-violated-human-rights-says-meghalaya-chief-minister,"The firing by Assam Police earlier this week which killed six persons was a clear incident of violation of human rights, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma told the National Human Rights Commission on Friday.
Sangma also urged the human rights body to take action in the matter.
Five of those killed in the police shooting on Tuesday were residents of Meghalaya, while one was an official of the Assam Forest Guard, Sangma had claimed, adding the village was part of his state. The Assam government, however, had claimed that only four persons were killed and that the village fell under its jurisdiction.
Territorial disputes between the two states had begun when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam on January 21, 1972, under the Assam Reorganisation Act, 1971. Disputes arose after Meghalaya had challenged the law.
On Friday, Sangma met officials of the National Human Rights Commission, including the body’s Chairperson Arun Mishra.
“Apprised them about the actions that have been taken like the central agency enquiry into the matter,” he wrote in a tweet after the meeting. The chief minister said that at the meeting, he stressed on the need for the “proper sensitisation of forces deputed in sensitive border areas”.
The firing incident
The firing took place on Tuesday after Assam forest officials stopped a truck allegedly carrying smuggled timber. The violence occurred in the “Mukroh” village, which is a part of Meghalaya’s West Jaintia Hills district. But the Assam government calls it “Mukhrow”, claiming the village is part of its West Karbi Anglong district.
A day after the firing, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the police action appeared to have been unnecessary and unprovoked. The Assam Cabinet has also decided to transfer the inquiry into the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183837-hlkpsobqnt-1670135475.jfif

The police have also named three journalists – Vikas Singh, Ankur Pratap Singh and Shahbaz – in the first information report. The case was filed based on a complaint by a Rampur resident named Nadeem Khan.
The alleged incident took place on December 5, when bye-elections to the Assembly constituency of Rampur were held. The Samajwadi Party leader is the son of former Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan.
The complainant alleged that when he was heading to the polling centre, Khan and the three journalists, along with a crowd of supporters, stopped him and asked him to show his identification documents. He claimed that when he refused to show them his documents, they assaulted and abused him.
“They threatened me and said that if I come to vote, I will end up losing my life,” Nadeem Khan alleged.
He claimed that the Samajwadi Party leader also threatened his friend Meherban Ali when he asked him why he was stopping people from voting.
Nadeem Khan further alleged that Abdullah Khan and his supporters repeatedly entered the polling booth on the day of voting. He claimed that the crowd of supporters was preventing the police from checking the identities of those who were entering the polling booth.
The police have invoked sections of the Indian Penal Code pertaining to rioting, false statements in connection with an election, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation, voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant and disobedience to order issued by a public servant.
The Rampur bye-poll was necessitated by Khan’s disqualification as an MLA on account of his conviction in a hate speech case. The result will be declared on December 8.",https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/dwrxxltcmh-1537292161.jpg

He made the remarks at a meeting of the Congress steering committee in New Delhi.
Kharge said that while there are some very responsible office-bearers in the Congress who carry out their duties, some believe that a lack of responsibility on their part will be ignored.
“This is neither right nor acceptable,” the Congress president said. “Those who are unable to fulfil their responsibility, they will have to make way for their colleagues.”
Kharge said that the biggest responsibility of Congress leaders towards the party and the country was organisational accountability at all levels. “If the Congress organisation is strong, accountable, lives up to the expectations of the people, then only we will be able to win elections and serve the people of the country,” he said, according to PTI.

ISRO conspiracy case: Supreme Court sets aside bail to four accused former officers,"Dec 02, 2022 · 01:10 pm",https://scroll.in/latest/1038854/isro-conspiracy-case-supreme-court-sets-aside-bail-to-four-accused-former-officers,"The Supreme Court on Friday set aside the anticipatory bail granted by Kerala High Court to four former senior officials of law enforcement agencies in connection with the conspiracy to frame former Indian Space Research Organisation scientist Nambi Narayanan in an espionage case, Bar and Bench reported.
The order was passed on a plea by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
The central agency had begun its investigation into the wrongful arrest of Narayan and others following a Supreme Court order in April based on a report filed by a three-member committee led by retired judge DK Jain. The court had tasked Jain to investigate the officials responsible in the case because of which the prominent space scientist was falsely implicated.
The four accused men are former Intelligence Bureau officers RB Sreekumar, PS Jayaprakash, Thampi S Durga Dutt and retired Superintendent of Police S Vijayan.
The court on Friday said that the accused persons shall not be arrested for five week ssubject to their cooperation with the investigation.
“The matter is remitted to the High Court to be decided afresh in the light of our observations,” the court said. “The High Court is to decide the matter preferably within 4 weeks.”
ISRO espionage case
Narayanan and six others were accused of selling secrets pertaining to ISRO’s cryogenic programme to women who were allegedly spying for Russia, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence and other countries.
He and two others – Bengaluru-based businessmen Chandrasekharan and SK Sharam – were arrested in November 1994 on charges of espionage. The case was later handed over to the CBI. In its final report to the chief judicial magistrate in April 1996, the CBI had said there was lack of evidence to substantiate the accusations.
All the accused persons were acquitted by a division bench of the Kerala High Court. In its order, the court had said there was no need to take action against the former director general of police and retired superintendents of police KK Joshua and S Vijayan.
In 2015, Narayanan moved the Supreme Court seeking criminal and disciplinary action against the officers. He accused them of falsely implicating him in the case. In September 2018, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court said Narayanan was a victim of the allegations made by the Kerala Police.
The Supreme Court said Narayanan’s arrest was “needless and unnecessary” and granted him a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for being subjected to mental cruelty in the case. Besides this, the National Human Rights Commission recommended Rs 10 lakh compensation.
Narayanan had filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court to challenge the Kerala government’s decision to not take any action against erring police officers.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184157-zmtqmeaepe-1670673524.jpg

The High Court had made the remarks about Imam in its October 18 order denying bail to activist Umar Khalid in a case pertaining to an alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2020 Delhi riots.
The High Court had said that Imam was arguably at the “head of the conspiracy” to orchestrate violence. A bench comprising Justices Siddharth Mridul and Rajnish Bhatnagar had also referred to meetings that allegedly took place between Imam and Khalid ahead of the violence.
Imam has been charged for allegedly making inflammatory speeches about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which incited riots in the National Capital.
The Delhi Police have alleged that the violence in February 2020 was part of a larger conspiracy to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and was hatched by those who organised the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
Communal violence had broken out in North East Delhi between February 23 and February 26, 2020. The clashes claimed 53 lives and hundreds were injured. The majority of those killed were Muslims.
On December 7, Imam, in a special leave petition before the Supreme Court, said that the High Court had made the observations about him without giving him an opportunity to present his stand. He added that the observations are related to the merits of a criminal case in which he also faces accusations, and thus, the remarks could adversely affect his bail application.
The Supreme Court on Friday noted that paragraph 68 of the High Court’s judgement had said that its observations should not have any impact on the merits of the case. “Therefore we clarify that any observation made regarding the role of the petitioner will not prejudice the petitioner in any manner,” the Supreme Court said, according to Bar and Bench.
A bench of Justices SK Kaul and AS Oka remarked that such observations are made when bail appeals are heard at length, in a manner similar to hearings of final appeals against conviction. “Bail applications should be heard for not more than 10 minutes,” the court orally remarked.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/130840-naexxcawix-1607582789.jpg

The Aam Aadmi Party made the allegations at a press conference led by MP Sanjay Singh who was accompanied by three party councillors – Ronakshi Sharma, Arun Nawariya, and Jyoti Rani.
On December 7, the Aam Aadmi Party had won 134 out of 250 wards in the elections to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The BJP, which had ruled the civic body for the last 15 years, finished second with 104 seats.

On Saturday, Singh alleged that the BJP was resorting to “dirty tricks” despite having lost 80 seats as compared to the previous election. The Rajya Sabha MP claimed that a man named Yogendra had called Sharma and said that Adesh Gupta, the chief of the BJP’s Delhi unit, would speak with her.
“Adesh Gupta ji and BJP leaders were speaking of a budget of Rs 100 crore to buy 10 councillors,” Singh claimed.
“The BJP is resorting to the same tactics that it used in Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa, and Gujarat,” the AAP MP alleged, urging the Delhi Police commissioner to investigate the allegations.
Singh also asked how the BJP could speak of holding the mayor’s post in Delhi, when it won 30 wards less than the AAP. “Is there any meaning left to the popular mandate and democracy in the country?” he asked, and alleged that the BJP has turned into a “kidnapping gang”.
Earlier in the day, the BJP also accused the AAP of luring its councillors into its fold. Party leader Harish Khuranna alleged that “[AAP chief Arvind] Kejriwal’s agent Shikha Garg” was luring councillors to join the BJP.
The BJP’s vice-president Baijayant Jay Panda alleged that attempts were made to lure a councillor, Monika Pant, into the AAP.
“A party which claims to be ‘kattar imandar’ [scrupulously honest] stands thoroughly exposed today,” he said. “The attempt to lure our newly elected councillor Dr Monika Pant into supporting AAP is one of the many instances of the brazen corruption methods of Arvind Kejriwal Ji and his team.”

The Centre made the statement in a short affidavit filed in response to a petition by advocate and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. The petitioner has sought directions to the Union and state governments to take steps to prevent black magic, superstition and forceful religious conversions.
The affidavit, filed through the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, said that the government was aware of the seriousness of the matter. The official said that the demands made in the petition would be taken up “in all seriousness” by the government.
“It is submitted that the right to freedom of religion does not include a fundamental right to convert other people to a particular religion,” the Centre said. “The said right certainly does not include the right to convert an individual through fraud, deception, coercion, allurement or other such means.”
The government said that fradulent or induced conversion impinges on the right to freedom of conscience of an individual, according to PTI. It added that the Supreme Court has already held that the word “propagate” under Article 25 of the Constitution does not refer to the right to convert a person, but a right to spread one’s religion by speaking about its tenets.
The constitutional provision states that all persons have the right to freely “profess, practise and propagate religion”.
The Supreme Court told the Centre to file a detailed affidavit with information from state governments about steps taken on the matter, Live Law reported. The case will be heard next on December 5.
Upadhyay, in his petition, contended that the victims of forced or fraudulent conversions are often socially and economically underprivileged, particularly belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes.
The petition said that such practices not only offend Articles 14 (equality before law), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the Constitution, but are also against the principles of secularism, which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
In the previous hearing of the case on November 14, the court had described forced conversions as a “serious issue” and had told the Centre to make its stand clear on the matter.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/182106-qpivwpujjh-1667202838.jpg

The Anti-Corruption Bureau had filed a first information report in the case in 2016 based on a complaint by Barkha Shukla Singh, a former chief of the women’s panel. Singh had accused Maliwal of nepotism and favouritism in the appointment of 87 staff members in the Delhi Commission for Women from August 6, 2015, to August 1, 2016.
Special Judge Dig Vinay Singh framed charges against Maliwal, Promila Gupta, Sarika Chaudhary and Farheen Malick under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (criminal conspiracy) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act dealing with criminal misconduct by a public servant, the Hindustan Times reported.
The judge observed that a “strong suspicion” arises against the accused persons and that the facts of the case prima facie provide enough material to frame charges.
The court said that the women’s panel had been urging the Delhi government to fill vacant posts but the government did not respond promptly. The judge said this did not give the commission the right to make arbitrary appointments.
“The facts do create a strong suspicion that recruitments to various posts were made during the impugned tenure of the accused persons for different remunerations in arbitrary manner, violating all rules and regulations in which the near and dear ones were appointed and remunerations were given to them from public exchequer,” the judge said.
The prosecution has alleged that at least 20 out of the 87 appointed persons were directly associated with the Aam Aadmi Party. It alleged that the appointments were made without issuing any advertisements for the posts.
Maliwal has said that the case would not act as a deterrent for her. She has said that the Delhi Commission for Women would continue to work and ask questions, and claimed that this was what was “disturbing her opponents the most”, according to the Hindustan Times.
“Even if I am sent to jail, I will prepare a report on the condition of women there and submit it to the Delhi government,” Maliwal had said.",https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/156145-mjfresrlxc-1620712043.jpg

On October 27, billionaire Elon Musk completed his $44 billion (over Rs 3,36,910 crore) takeover of Twitter, following which he cut about half of its workforce. The lawsuit alleging disproportionate targeting of female employees was filed by two women whose employment was terminated by Twitter last month.
The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a federal court in San Francisco, said that Twitter laid off 57% of its female workers, compared with 47% of men. It also said that in engineering roles, 63% of women were laid off as against 48% of men.
The plaintiffs have also accused the company of contravening federal and California laws banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sex.
“It’s not a huge surprise unfortunately that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,” Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said, reported The Guardian.
Twitter is also facing lawsuits with respect to its alleged failure to provide proper notices about layoffs to workers and contractors. Some plaintiffs have also alleged that Musk’s demands that employees should return to offices and work long hours discriminated against disabled workers.
Three workers have also claimed that they faced retaliation for seeking better working conditions at Twitter.

Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that such restrictions were nothing but patriarchy under the guise of providing protection, Bar and Bench reported.
The court was hearing a plea filed by a group of students challenging a notification issued by the Higher Education Department of the state barring girls from going out of their hostel after 9.30 pm.
The court directed the competent authorities to explain the rationale behind imposing such restrictions, adding that they could be justified only due to “compelling reasons”.
“...Girls, as much as boys, are fully capable of taking care of themselves, and if not, it must be the endeavour of the state and the public authorities to make them so competent, rather than being locked in,” the court observed.
The petitioners contended that the restrictions had been implemented for women’s hostels only, and not in the men’s accommodation. The restrictions are also beyond the scope of statutory powers given under Section 42 of the Kerala University of Health Sciences Act, they argued, according to Bar and Bench.
