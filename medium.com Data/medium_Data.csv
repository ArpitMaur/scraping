"No, Elon and Jack are not “competitors.” They’re collaborating.",Dave Troy,Oct 29,https://davetroy.medium.com/no-elon-and-jack-are-not-competitors-theyre-collaborating-3e88cde5267d?source=home---------73------------------0----------,"Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter has been met with surprise, derision, and gnashing of teeth — and an overwhelming amount of well-intentioned but poorly-informed commentary and analysis.As someone who has followed the company closely since its inception and has had a chance to talk in depth about technical topics with Jack Dorsey and the company’s other founders over the years, I have a different view.Here’s a series of common questions regarding the deal and the relationship between Dorsey and Musk about which I see the most errors and misconceptions.Q: Jack Dorsey is launching “Bluesky,” a new social network to compete with Twitter. I’ll just join that instead!A: Sorry to disappoint, but Dorsey played a key role in Musk’s deal to take Twitter private. The two are good friends. And Bluesky is an initiative launched by Twitter. In April, Dorsey wrote, “In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” [Update: Dorsey did not transact his shares in Twitter, and now holds equity in Musk’s venture.]Q: Uh, if “no one should own or run Twitter,” why did Dorsey advocate selling it to Musk… I’m confused?A: To get it out of the hands of Wall Street investors, and turn it into a “public good at a protocol level, not a company.” Dorsey and Musk believe it can do more good for humanity if it’s an open technology than if it’s a company owned by any one person or by Wall Street investors trying to maximize profits for shareholders.Q: What do you mean, a “public good at a protocol level?” What even is that?A: The foundation of the Internet is built on protocols that we mostly take for granted now. TCP/IP and HTTPS enable the web. Modern e-mail is built on top of SMTP and IMAP protocols. Usenet newsgroups are built on top of NNTP. Dorsey envisions a foundational “Twitter” protocol that anyone can implement and run. This would need to become a formal Internet standard, which requires going through the Internet Engineering Task Force’s “Request for Comment” (RFC) process. This can take a long time. This is what Bluesky has been working on starting to map out.Q: But the Bluesky website says its Beta is “launching soon.” Doesn’t that mean it’s close to ready?A: It means they’re ready for you to start experimenting with some ideas. It doesn’t mean it’s close to being a “product” or “useful,” or some sort of viable competitor with any other product or service. And as of yet it’s difficult to know exactly what a service might look like. Eventually, it might form the basis for a new implementation of Twitter that would replace the current product, and it could be open for others to interoperate with — if they can build a functional and useful protocol, which may take years.Q: This all sounds crazy. Doesn’t Musk want to make money by owning Twitter?A: The goals are more ideological in nature. Musk and his backers believe that the global geopolitical arena was being warped by too much “woke” ideology and censorship, and wanted to fix that by first restoring voices that had previously been silenced —and then implementing technical and algorithmic solutions that allow each user to get the experience they want. They think this can “solve” the problems that people cite about social media content. Making money, they figure, will come from the secondary effects of enabling “free speech” and the possibility of building other services like payments and replacing government on top of such an app. Plus the company’s social graph data is a goldmine for other businesses that may wish to benefit from detailed knowledge of the makeup of society.Q: Uh, isn’t it naive to think that there’s a technical solution to harmful content? Isn’t that likely to lead to more radicalization and cultish behavior?A: Yes, it’s completely naive and they are being willfully ignorant of the harmful side effects of content. It is a kind of tech fundamentalist solutionism that posits that for any difficult problem, there must be a technical solution. Many sociologists and cultural scholars would argue differently.Q: What does Dorsey mean, “I trust [Musk’s] mission to extend the light of consciousness?”A: This is a reference to “longtermism,” the heavily marketed philosophy being promoted by Musk and his friend William MacAskill that asserts the only thing that matters is humanity’s future in space, and that the only goal of the living is to maximize the number of future humans alive, as well as the number of artificial intelligence instances that could possibly exist in the future. This mandate is most often used to brush aside calls for improving conditions and alleviating suffering among the living here on Earth now. Because, the theory goes, giving a poor person a blanket isn’t likely to be as useful for the future of humanity as building a rocket to Mars. Longtermism is heavily influenced by “Russian Cosmism” and is also directly adjacent to “Effective Altruism.” Musk’s stated mission, which he intends to fulfill in his lifetime, is to “make humanity a multiplanetary species.” The anti-democratic urge in longtermism is rooted in the belief that “mob rule” will lead to nuclear annihilation; we should, Musk thinks, be guided by “wiser” minds — like his and Putin’s apparently.Q: Okay, so Musk and Dorsey are collaborators in some weird Mars cult, and don’t actually care about making money from Twitter?A: Yeah, you’re getting it. Musk also seems pretty interested in helping advance Putin’s “multipolar world order,” which is why he plays footsie with QAnon and MAGA accounts, and pals around with Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. “How are things going in Bakhmut?,” Musk asked Medvedev.Q: So this is why Musk has been so supportive of the Russians lately? I thought he was on Ukraine’s side, since he helped them out with Starlink?A: It’s best to look at Musk as a kind of power broker between multiple parties, including Ukraine and Russia. SpaceX was made possible by laws passed by Dana Rohrabacher, Putin’s favorite Congressman. He really doesn’t like the US government, the SEC, and our politicians, and all things considered, he’d probably prefer to replace all of it with an app — call it “X,” the everything app. Elon might say: “Do we really need a government, or could everyone just vote with an app? Be honest.”Q: So Musk wants to overthrow governments, and Dorsey is helping?A: Don’t be so dramatic. Everyone knows that the only way to advance society is through technocracy. Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was involved in the technocracy movement in Canada in the 1930’s and was arrested — because it was seen as a threat to the government. The philosopher James Burnham wrote in his 1941 book, “The Managerial Revolution” that society should be run by technical managers, not elected politicians. Russian “methodologists” and “political technologists” concluded the same thing in the 1990’s when they realized that “democracy” would just lead to mob-rule by populists. Democracy, they concluded, must be managed. This is what Putin has concluded, also.Q: So Putin, Musk, and Dorsey share the same vision?A: It’s complicated. All seem to think a “multipolar world” is a good thing, because after all, shouldn’t Russia get to do its thing and not be bothered by anyone else? That’s “free speech” and opposes “cancel culture,” right? So yeah, that’s aligned with Putin. But Putin himself doesn’t support free speech; his government censors wildly, but it does support speech that breaks the hegemony of the Western elites. As do Musk and friends. This is internally inconsistent.Q: Back to the money thing… won’t advertisers balk at all this potential chaos, and won’t Twitter’s business model suffer?A: Musk and the people backing all this are more interested in reshaping the global order than in earning fake “fiat currency.” Their real goal is to usher in “hard currency” and re-base global currencies around scarcity and physical assets. So no it really doesn’t matter much what happens to Twitter’s ad model in the meantime. It will probably do alright, and they can probably find other ways to make money, like adding in payments and weird Dogecoin schemes.Q: How is Twitter going to help them kill off fiat currency? You mean like replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency?A: As the Russian “methodologists” will tell you, it’s incredibly important to control the information space if you want to alter the real world. As the world plunges deeper into war and economic chaos in 2023–2024, there are real (perceived) opportunities to advance cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens to replace the dollar. Whether any of this is realistic or not remains to be seen, but this is what they’d like to pursue — Musk and his deal backers in particular. [Update: Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal announced he is the second largest shareholder in Twitter; Saudi Arabia has long sought to unseat the dollar as the reserve currency.]Q: So this is why Musk seemingly “overpaid” for Twitter? He and his backers want to use it as a tool of information warfare, to kill off the dollar and help usher in Putin’s “multipolar world?”A: Yes, that’s why they “overpaid” for Twitter. Because the end goals have nothing to do with Twitter or its ad model by itself. It’s merely a means to an end. Musk is likely to join forces with Trump’s Truth Social and Kanye West’s Parler to try to control much of the information space. And they’ve got the threat of Putin’s nukes to force the issue.Q: So isn’t Musk’s ownership of Twitter a national security risk? Shouldn’t the deal have been stopped on national security grounds?A: Yes, this is all a national security risk and the deal should probably have been stopped. The fact that it wasn’t is reflective of either fecklessness or capture of the US government.Q: Can Musk and his friends really do all this? Should we really be worried? It seems so far-fetched.A: That remains to be seen, and it’s unlikely they can achieve all they’d like to on the timeline they’d prefer. It will likely take years to make Bluesky into a viable product. However, just because it’s hard doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. As for the broader anti-government agenda, as we’ve seen with January 6th and other attempts to challenge government, even unsuccessful efforts can be incredibly damaging. It’s worth monitoring the direction this takes and, the effects that it has on society and democracy.A few other minor corrections to popular commentary on the deal:For the record I think Elon is a sociopath, and that this all is going to end in disaster — I just couldn’t stand seeing so much shallow, poorly informed analysis proliferate. So I’ve done my best here to set the record straight.Ultimately we are dealing with the fact that social engineering through control of the information environment is an inevitable reality—the only question is who has the means and moral authority to do it. (I’ve written a whitepaper about this set of concerns here.)If democracy-minded people don’t seize control of the information environment, powerful sociopathic autocrats will do so instead. We leave a power vacuum open at our peril, and at the moment, Musk and Putin are the ones with the most will to fill it.For additional background: Read my piece Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink, which outlines many of the ideological and historical underpinnings of this movement.I’ve known Jack Dorsey since 2007 and was the first external developer to utilize the Twitter API, for a project called Twittervision, which was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in 2008. I’ve done a lot of data visualization and data-driven journalism using the Twitter API since then. I’m currently focused on investigative journalism about information warfare and threats to democracy. Follow my work at davetroy.com."
Leave No Trace,Microsoft Design,Oct 25,https://medium.com/@MicrosoftDesign/leave-no-trace-12551b3d51b3?source=home---------90------------------0----------,"How product designers can break from the status quo and help our planetBy Ryan HayenHow long are you awake in the morning before you go online? Perhaps it’s while you’re still lying in bed, using a news feed or social media as the needed stimulant to push you out from under the covers. Or maybe you wait to open your device until after a warm shower and cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, you might say you never signed off in the first place.And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is probably what enabled you to stay in touch with family, or complete entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this sounds familiar, then you live in a part of the world where an internet connection now counts as an essential utility — one that’s as easy to take for granted as the natural gas heating your shower water or the electricity powering your coffee maker.But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally, just over 55% of today’s households have an internet connection. This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is referred to as the digital divide, and access is skewed toward richer nations. The gap is projected to close in the next decade as billions of homes connect to the internet for the first time and by 2030 it’s estimated that the technology industry could account for 20% of the global electricity demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On one hand, it supports livelihoods, educations, and bolsters the global economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps, websites, and services that we build will place an even greater strain on our already-overloaded power grids.These forecasts underscore a big carbon impact for all those pretty pixels and the devices that power them! If you read our previous article, the realization that Digital = Physical is becoming alarmingly clear and this poses our key challenge: how do we enable people from all communities to benefit from increased use of technology, without worsening the polluting and extractive impacts of tech?Microsoft has aggressive climate goals aimed at eliminating our carbon emissions, including emissions from the usage of our products and services. To help both ourselves and the industry begin to navigate the complex landscape of the climate crisis and product development, we recently published our Green Design Principles.The ideas, questions, and actions contained in the Green Design Principles are intended to shine a light on the distance between where we are as an industry and where we aspire to be. They are by no means complete or perfect, but they represent a first step! Microsoft’s Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering training says it well: sustainability isn’t one optimization or inclusive design action, it’s thousands. We recognize that some of the concepts presented here challenge us to reconsider long-standing business conventions or practices, such as attention demanding notifications or growth for the sake of growth.Given the urgency of the climate crisis, we share this in-progress work to gain feedback from the design community. Through a two-part post, we’ll take a deeper dive into these emerging principles, and pose questions and actions so that we might steer our industry toward a more sustainable future.We believe that small changes lead to big changes, everyone has a role to play, and helping promote the discussion about sustainability will empower others to raise their voices. These principles were inspired by and built upon numerous other frameworks, which you can check out at the end of this post.A challenge that digital product makers often face is that the projects they touch are commonly speeding down the road by the time they’re brought in. This can be frustrating for those who have been taught or believe that business follows design, instead of seeing it as a partnership. In reality, the business objectives have already been determined, and the solution needs to be delivered as quickly as possible. Furthermore, there may be minimal budget allocated for deeper design and research, and we may be the only one who has thought once about the environmental sustainability what we’re building.

As we take on the challenge of sparking a sustainable design revolution, we’ll have to think bigger than just pushing design dogma on others, and instead maximize its impact through strategic partnerships and building the connection between sustainability and business success. We’ll need to be intentional about how we nudge entire organizations and systems beyond just user-centered design, and toward a more expansive mindset that brings societal and planetary justice into our decision making.In part one of two below, let’s further explore the how first principle of “Think Bigger Before You Start” asks us to challenge the status quo and put care first.Challenging the status quo means asking the right questions and realizing that the future is indeed changeable. In doing so, we aim to arrive at business practices that are more resilient and restore balance to the systems we are a part of. Here are some possible actions that could help kickstart the process of reprogramming our industry habits.Balance user needs with finite resources — This action prompts us to dispel the illusion that any digital project is infinitely scalable without costs to the finite resources of the environment, mental and physical health of our customers, and society. To draw attention to the depletion of these resources, it helps to ask the following at the onset of new work:These questions merely start the conversation, but could begin to nudge a team away from a ‘growth for growth’s sake’ mentality and feature bloat, and toward a better understanding of users’ core needs — which can result in a competitive edge. Organizations might enjoy financial reward by creating superior tools that complete a focused set of tasks with excellence, rather than building Swiss army knife tools that check many boxes without doing any one thing great.Build on existing knowledge and work — Prior to building something new, what if we looked at what’s already working out there? Rather than building large pieces of a software solution from scratch, or purchasing parts from a supplier, teams should explore the possibility of building upon open-source projects. Choosing to go this route not only avoids the energy spend of duplicative work, but projects with strong communities can lead to more resilient software and help insure against the risk of a single supplier failing.When it comes to helping solve for more acute climate problems, how can we uplift and learn from those that are on the front lines? In the United States, at least 50 indigenous tribes have assessed climate risks and developed plans to tackle them. Their ability to set laws independently of federal or state governments has led to innovative programs around detecting disease in the fish populations that are critical for their nutrition and culture, water management, and more.

In tech we often have a bias toward believing that the code we write is better than code written by others, or the tools our industry provides are the most equipped to solve any problem it encounters in the real world. Put another way, we can often be looking for a problem that fits our solution. When it comes to the climate crisis, we should swim upstream against this habit and instead build tools that embrace work already accomplished by others, tools that allow hyper-local communities to take the lead.

Many thanks to the Design Justice Network from which this action is borrowed!Transition alongside our partners — When it comes to sustainability, every company and every customer is at a different stage and it’s important to consider and/or meet people where they’re at. For those who are very early on in their sustainability efforts, it presents an opportunity to bring people along as we move toward more balanced and resilient solutions. If we make an earnest effort in educating and installing incentive structures that reward use of renewable energy or more sustainable business operations, it’s possible that we can turn the tide in a more comprehensive and collaborative fashion.Dig deeper into the metrics and impact — If you base a team’s success and rewards on a singular metric like Daily Active Users or Revenue, they will put their efforts into maximizing it. In many cases, this can result in tactics that are wasteful and create harmful effects on large populations. In all projects, it’s important to pause and ask, “what metric(s) are we basing success on right now and why?”. Further, what other measurements for success could we include to better steer our tactics away from harmful outcomes, and how could we measure if we satisfied the true user need?We should also expand our designs methodologies to consider not just humans, but non-humans. For example, what if we considered the health of rivers, endangered animals, or air quality measurements in how we define our product’s impact?The principle of putting care first might be the easiest one to think about and the hardest one to carry out, especially when business objectives, timelines, or even personalities may work against it. Although it can feel like a constant uphill battle, now more than ever we must exercise our ability to identify the relationships between the things we build and the larger systemic issues that they may uphold.

In the context of the climate crisis, what does it mean to put care first and how can we start to do it?Justice — There’s plenty of lore in Silicon Valley about products that were built in a garage or dorm room, only to take over the world a few years later. While the ‘sole creator’ legend has made for entertaining movies, tech now operates with such ubiquity and scale that there’s much more at stake when we consider the range of outcomes our creations can have. We need to move from a model of designing for people, to designing with people. This means growing beyond usability testing or even customer interviews, to forming deeper working partnerships with communities that are directly and indirectly impacted by the outcome of the design process and the climate impacts it contributes to. One model to reference is the city of Seattle’s community liaison program, which pays representatives of different neighborhood communities to consult directly with city project leaders. The liaisons communicate the needs and feedback of their members, which then is then incorporated into the planning process for major projects such as the building of a new transit station.We must continually assess the power dynamics between our teams and local communities, finding ways to learn with and from them about how our products could do harm or create disadvantages. Building more direct pathways for two-way communication will also enable us to identify if our product ideas are reinforcing economic inequity, systemic racism, or disproportionately negatively affecting marginalized groups.To help get started, check out Microsoft’s resources for Harms Modeling, which provides an assessment matrix with factors such as risk of injury and infringement on human rights. Also, our guide on creating and running Community Juries is helpful in creating a forum where your product team can hear about the perceptions and concerns surrounding the project directly from the external stakeholders that are impacted.Resilience — Climate driven emergencies or disasters are becoming the norm. They might result from extreme record heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought, tornadoes during the winter, and so on. The impact of these experiences can be very individualized for populations based on where they live, the local infrastructure, and their preparedness levels.Our users will inevitably experience our products differently in times of crisis, and therefore we should start envisioning them being used in such situations. In doing so, we must work to understand the wide range of environmental, emotional, and health scenarios that people might be experiencing at any given time.

In action this means asking:Stay tuned for a second post exploring tactics around building better by default, and please share any thoughts you might have in the comments below!This blog post is a continued discussion on the Green Design Principles which were originally created by the following people who came together to advance the mission of designing for sustainable futures: Abigail Cawley, Aditi Khazanchi, Anna Alfut, Caitlin Esworthy Greene, Chelsea Braun, Connie Huang, Danielle McClune, Emily Lynam, Jennifer Bost, Martyn Gooding, Pragya Gupta, Rachel Bergman, Ryan Hayen, Sandra Pallier, Sarah Shing, Shane Tierney, Shelley Bjornstad, Soumitri Vadali, and Sue Nguyen.Thanks to Projects by IF, a global design company that is redesigning trust in technology, who wrote the original Society Centered-Design manifesto that inspired our thinking.We’d also like to thank the Design Justice Network for their Design Justice Principles, as well as the folks behind Green Software Engineering, Sustainable Service Design, Sustainable Interaction Design, Sustainable Web Design, Digital Earth Experience Principles, and Knowledge Co-Production in Sustainability Research"
"The Real Left Brain, Right Brain Story?",John Kruse,Oct 28,https://medium.com/invisible-illness/the-real-left-brain-right-brain-story-669805a64fbf?source=home---------72------------------0----------,"For the last few decades, the popular interpretation of research on human cerebral hemisphere lateralization has cast the left brain as Mr. Spock: logical, rational, adept at math and language, with Captain Kirk embodying the right brain: impulsive, intuitive, emotional, creative. You can take tests that purport to show which hemisphere dominates your thinking style.Usually, they lionize the left hemisphere as the more reasonable half and the one that should be in charge. But a magisterial book by psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist has been substantially, if slowly, changing this perception, turning our older understanding of hemispheric differences on its head, so to speak.McGilchrist taught literature at Oxford before attending medical school, becoming a psychiatrist, and launching a career in brain imaging research. In 2009 he published The Master and His Emissary, reshaping how we understand how the two hemispheres work together, with important implications not just for neuroscience, but for psychiatry, philosophy, history, and the comprehension of our current era as well.McGilchrist presented his theory in exquisite detail (more than 450 pages) and with exhaustive references (at least 1870 footnotes) to back up his assertions. The following is my attempt to distill his ideas. Any faults with oversimplification or outright errors are mine.Roger Sperry won the Nobel Prize in 1981 for his work with “split brain” patients, individuals in whom the corpus callosum, the neuronal bundle connecting the two hemispheres, had been damaged, surgically severed, or failed to develop.His work built on more than a century of lesion studies — examining the brains of people with focal damage to try to determine what essential functions had been impaired by the destruction of specific brain regions. Over the past forty years, Sperry’s students and colleagues, particularly psychologist Michael Gazzaniga, have advanced Sperry’s research and popularized the roles of the two hemispheres.This body of research underpinned the pop psychology that designated certain functions to each hemisphere- language, logic, and linear thinking to the dominant left, and holistic, intuitive, impulsive reactions to the subservient right brain. The right brain was considered good at art and music and other subjects that American public education finds worthy of devoting a mere hour to each week if that.McGilchrist spends the first half of The Master and His Emissary summarizing not just human research, but looking at brain lateralization across the animal kingdom. Rather than just contemplating what each hemisphere does, and divvying up tasks assigned to one-half brain or the other, one of McGilchrist’s brilliant insights was that the hemispheres differ primarily in how they work, including how they apprehend the world, interact with each other, and create our understanding of life.Designating different functions for each hemisphere was essentially an incomplete, left-brain way to think about the differences between the hemispheres.After immersing himself in neuroscience for two decades, McGilchrist felt that the field had inadequately addressed two big questions. Why across species, is the brain a bilateral structure, with two very similar masses yoked in parallel where one would seemingly suffice? Nature didn’t go through the trouble to design and preserve such intricate biology in order to just have a spare. The very existence of mirror-image hemispheres implies some division of labor, some separate role for each half.His second question was why, if the two hemispheres need to communicate to create a unitary experience of consciousness (or for some other reason) are most of the fibers in the corpus callosum carrying functionally inhibitory input to the other hemisphere?The human corpus callosum carries neuronal projections that only reach about 2% of the neurons in the other hemisphere, but the majority of these are either directly inhibitory connections or activate inhibitory interneurons in the other hemisphere. Rather than sharing information, the corpus callosum primarily serves to silence parts of the contralateral hemisphere.McGilchrist’s answer to these questions begins by focusing on focus. Animals face two tasks of utmost importance: they need to feed themselves, and they need to avoid becoming someone else’s food. These tasks require very different types of attention. Focusing on feeding requires a very narrow focus, usually just a few degrees of the visual field, to ascertain that one is identifying something familiar and edible, as well as grasping it and conveying it to the mouth.Looking out for danger, in contrast, necessitates scanning the whole environment, and being attuned to what is new, different, and potentially threatening. One needs to understand the context and relationships between objects in the environment.These two types of focus operate in mutually exclusive ways. Splitting attention between two or more tasks, or multitasking, involves, at a neuronal level, rapidly shuttling back and forth between the two tasks. Alternating between tasks results in slower completion times and increases the likelihood of missing information. Since procuring food and avoiding becoming prey to others are both essential for living, each of these tasks became the purview of separate hemispheres.The left hemisphere evolved expertise in narrow focus, to identify and grasp food. The right hemisphere took the opposite tack, and specialized in scanning the whole sensory world for problems, to avoid being eaten or other disasters.The right brain looks at the whole world, is attuned to context, and is concerned with what is possible, not just what is certain. It is immersed in the moment, engaged with what is living and animate, and attentive to relationships and connections. It holistically extracts implicit information about the world and what is important. The right brain also informs the left brain where to start looking.The left brain focuses on what is safe, edible, and procurable. It experiences just a piece of the world at a time, and constructs, piecemeal, a map of that world and how to identify and grasp (physically and mentally) what it needs to survive. Its understanding is detached and abstract focused on certainty and utility. The left brain developed language and math as ways to codify, articulate, construct, and convey its comprehension of the world back to the right brain, and to other brains.The right brain then accepts this processed information from the left brain and uses it to refine its own outlook on the world. While the left brain’s perception of the world is precise, useful, and clearly defined, it is less expansive, less inclusive, and less aware of relationships and contexts than the right brain. The right brain is able to accept contradictions as well as implicit information that the left just can’t even see.The right brain’s job is to experience the world, the left to manipulate it. The right brain employs metaphors to create its understanding. The left views metaphors as imprecise, artsy, and even deceitful. The left brain uses algorithms to construct its pathway to truth and will reject observable “data” that conflict with its rules.McGilchrist also makes clear that the two hemispheres share a lot of similarities, and that the human brain does possess significant redundancies. While language is often considered the ultimate achievement of the left hemisphere, the right brain can actually understand much that is spoken to it. So the left/right discrepancies are not absolutes, but rather subtle, pervasive tendencies. Nevertheless, the pervasive differences accrue to create hemispheres that operate in complex and significantly different ways.In the second half of his treatise, McGilchrist addresses how the different modes of understanding the world and creating truth embraced by each hemisphere have influenced philosophy and history. The two hemispheres work best when cooperating, but with the right in charge, since only the right sees the whole picture.But starting with the Renaissance, and greatly accelerated by the rise of capitalism and consumerism in the last two centuries, the left hemisphere has become increasingly dominant in Western societies. This imbalance has happened too quickly to reflect a structural evolutionary change in the brain, rather it arises from a cultural conquering.For McGilchrist, the right hemisphere, rather than being the minor player, is the true master. It takes in the whole world of experience, apprehends it, and presents and delegates to the left what areas to focus on. The left dissects, rebuilds, understands and provides information back to the right. The left “makes a good servant, but a bad master”.The two hemispheres complement each other. The right brain would compliment the right if it could speak but is mute, so this is moot. The left brain though, believes it sees clearly what is true. It disparages information that is inconsistent, contradictory, or that can’t be clearly stated or defined by rules and abstractions. It deems all that it misses — context, implicit information, holistic knowledge, embodied experience, and living relationships as non-essential, non-factual, and either erroneous or irrelevant. When the left brain dominates, important information and relationships regarding the world get discarded.McGilchrist suggests at least five reasons for the recent subversion of the natural order of hemispheric dominance. The first is that the left brain’s mission statement is to grasp and manipulate (feed) the individual. Utilitarianism is seductive — it produces tangible results. Secondly, not only is the left brain grasping, it is more readily graspable.The left brain simplifies life and features consistency and rules, which makes its stance easier to understand and appreciate than the nebulous, uncertain, and self-contradictions embraced by the right brain. Thirdly, the left brain is much more able to express and articulate its perspective, and win arguments about its superiority, because the very process of arguing is a left brain strength.The fourth reason for the left brain’s recent supremacy is that science, technology, and bureaucracy are all left-brain productions and have powerfully shaped our world, particularly over the last 2–3 generations. So even if the right brain tries to immerse itself in the real world, (rather than just relying on a left brain map of the world), our physical world itself is increasingly a constructed, fabricated, left brain environment.Finally, the left brain’s failure to be aware of what it is missing gives it an advantage in vying for dominance. It simply demeans, devalues, and ignores the parts of reality that it can’t grasp — none of that really matters. Someone who cuts off parts of the course wins the race. All five of these factors recursively strengthen left brain dominance at a social and individual level.McGilchrist avoids becoming overtly political but makes a strong case that the inappropriate dominance of the left brain leads to many of the problems of the modern world. Aspects of global warming, racial and gender injustice, and political divisions arise from left-brain approaches that know the rules they have created for defining truth and blindly reject evidence from the lived world that might contradict their “knowledge”. Human lives themselves are diminished by rejecting and ignoring what we can’t fully comprehend or codify.Throughout the book, McGilchrist refers to autism and schizophrenia as conditions in which the left brain inappropriately dominates. He sees in autism the emphasis on rules, the detachment from relationships, the emphasis on parts rather than the whole, and the inability to grasp context as a warning about the direction our left-brain dominated society is trending in.Similarly, he interprets some of the bizarre delusions and hallucinations of schizophrenia as an unfettered left brain running amok — the left brain trying to make sense out of an isolated visual input or auditory sensation, and concocting stories based on the rules about the world it knows while ignoring how poorly that narrative fits with the actual world.McGilchrist doesn’t have much to say about ADHD, which is rather interesting, given his prioritization of attention as foundational to cerebral hemispheric differentiation. Many features of ADHD would suggest a right brain bias — being drawn to what is new, and readily bored with what is old; challenges in extracting rules or learning from experience; a desire to engage and embed in situations, rather than just observing; and strong tendencies for non-linear thinking.However, at least one ADHD tendency — missing social context because of hyper-focusing on a particular detail, would suggest an overemphasis on left-brain thinking. Maybe this speaks to ADHD being fundamentally a problem with regulating attention, and not being a “deficit” in attention.McGilchrist himself would be among the first to point out that the right brain — left brain roles that he has identified don’t explain everything about the human cortex. A lot is going on within each hemisphere, and some deviations from normal might reflect communication differences between the two hemispheres rather than just differences in dominance.A theory can be right even if some things get left out."

I had to close my laptop for a couple of days before writing this very short post.Over the last seven months, with the help of my team, I gave $1,990,800,000 to 343 organizations supporting the voices and opportunities of people from underserved communities. Of special note is that many of the organizations are funds. For anyone similarly interested in supporting the leadership of people from the communities they’re assisting, funds are a great resource. They pool donations and spread them across a diverse group of smaller organizations working toward a common cause. The funds we picked look for teams with lived experience in the issues they’re addressing, as we did when selecting the other non-profits in this giving cycle, and the 1,200+ recipients before them, many of which are also funds. You can learn more about any of them in the database we’ll be releasing soon, with information supplied by their own teams, and mission statements in their own words.I recently learned a saying used in disability communities: “Nothing about us without us.” For me, it’s another beautiful and powerful reminder. I needn’t ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves.Aajeevika BureauAccess LivingAchieve AtlantaAfrican Communities TogetherAl Otro LadoAlliance College-Ready Public SchoolsAlliance San DiegoAltarumAmber Charter SchoolsAmerica’s Promise AllianceAmerican Association of People with DisabilitiesAscend Public Charter SchoolsAsylum AccessAsylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP)Atlas Preparatory SchoolAutistic Self Advocacy NetworkBig Brothers Big Sisters of AmericaBlack Alliance for Just ImmigrationBlack LGBTQIA+ Migrant ProjectBlue Cross of Idaho Foundation for HealthBob Hope SchoolBoston Plan for Excellence (BPE)Bottom LineBoys TownBravenBreakthrough CollaborativeBright Star SchoolsBrooke Charter SchoolsBrothers Empowered to TeachBusara Center for Behavioral EconomicsCalifornia Community Foundation — housing and unrestrictedCalifornia Pan-Ethnic Health NetworkCampaign for Southern EqualityCarmen Schools of Science and TechnologyCenterLink: The Community of LGBT CentersCharter School Growth FundChicago Public SchoolsChinese-American Planning CouncilChoose LoveCleveland Metropolitan School DistrictCoalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA)CohereCollege Access: Research & Action (CARA)Collegiate AcademiesCommunity Academies of New OrleansComplete College AmericaComunidades Indigenas En LiderazgoCon Alma Health FoundationConey Island Preparatory Public Charter SchoolContigo FundCORO IndiaCushing Public SchoolsDakota Medical FoundationDanville Regional FoundationDefine AmericanDesmond Tutu Health FoundationDetroit Public Schools Community DistrictDidi Hirsch Mental Health ServicesDigital Empowerment FoundationDurham Public SchoolsEducate!EnAble IndiaEndowment for HealthEpiscopal Health FoundationEquality Federation InstituteEscondido Union School DistrictEvidence ActionExcel Academy Charter SchoolsExcellence Community SchoolsEye to EyeFamilia: Trans Queer Liberation MovementFamily Focused Treatment Association (FFTA)Family Life Academy Charter SchoolsFirstLine SchoolsFlorence Immigrant & Refugee Rights ProjectFondo Lunaria MujerFood for EducationForo Internacional de Mujeres Indígenas (FIMI)Foundation for Amazon Sustainability (FAS)Foundation for Ecological SecurityFour Freedoms FundFreedom Prep Charter SchoolsFresno Unified School DistrictFriends of the ChildrenGeneration TeachGIREGirl Scouts of the USAGLAADGlobal Development IncubatorGlobal Fund for ChildrenGlobal Fund for Community FoundationsGlobal Greengrants FundGrand Prairie Independent School DistrictGrantmakers In HealthGreater Watertown Community Health FoundationGSA NetworkHaitian Bridge AllianceHarambee Youth Employment AcceleratorHeadwaters FoundationHealth Forward FoundationHealth Foundation for Western and Central New YorkHealthcare Georgia FoundationHenderson CollegiateHIVE Preparatory SchoolHmong American Peace AcademyIbtadaImmigrant Legal Resource CenterImmigrants RisingIndia Health Action TrustInnovations for Poverty Action (IPA)InspireNOLA Charter SchoolsInstituto de Liderazgo Simone de Beauvoir (ILSB)Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)International Initiative for Impact EvaluationJefferson County Public SchoolsJunior Achievement USAJustice In MotionKansas City Teacher ResidencyKilleen Independent School DistrictKings River Union ElementaryKIPP Colorado Public SchoolsKIPP Metro Atlanta SchoolsKIPP SoCal Public SchoolsKIPP St. Louis Public SchoolsLaboratoriaLatino Coalition for Community LeadershipLEARN Charter School NetworkLindsay Unified School DistrictLuminos FundLutheran Immigration and Refugee ServiceMaine Health Access FoundationMake the Road New YorkMarion County School DistrictMary Black FoundationMat-Su Health FoundationMetro Early College High SchoolMission Achievement and Success (MAS) Charter SchoolMontana Healthcare FoundationMovement Advancement ProjectNashville Teacher ResidencyNational Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)National Children’s AllianceNational Day Laborer Organizing NetworkNational Disability InstituteNational Indian Health BoardNational Institute for Children’s Health QualityNational Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC)National LGBTQ Task ForceNational Organization on DisabilityNational Partnership for New AmericansNational Partnership for Women & FamiliesNational Urban LeagueNative American Community AcademyNew Paradigm for EducationNoble Network of Charter SchoolsOne Million DegreesOneGoalOpportunities Industrialization Centers of America (OICA)Opportunity Finance NetworkParamount Schools of ExcellencePartnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA)Paso del Norte Health FoundationPATH FoundationPeerForwardPop Culture CollaborativePraekelt.orgRainbow RailroadRecovery CaféRefugePointRIP Medical DebtRISE Together FundRocky Mountain Preparatory SchoolsSallie B.

Writing Tools I Use All The Time,Clive Thompson,Oct 31,https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/writing-tools-i-use-all-the-time-7d8e661f6317?source=home---------38------------------0----------,"Every once in a while someone asks me — what tools and apps do you use in your writing?After giving that answer a couple of dozen times, I realize I should probably just write it down, so that it’s all in one place.So: Here we go!A throat-clearing preamble: I’m a nonfiction writer. Mostly I write long-form magazine pieces, books, and a Niagara of blogging. So long before I do any “writing”, I do a massive amount of research: I pore over books and reports and interview people, taking notes all the while. The tools below are focused heavily on the reporting-and-gathering-info process, far more than on “the act of crafting sentences”. So if you’re writing novels or screenplays, this list may not be useful for you.(BTW, if you dig this piece, it’s part of a series I’ve been doing on nonfiction writing techniques.)Forthwith, here’s A Guide To The Nine Essential Tools For My Reporting And Writing …Whenever I start a new piece of work that requires a ton of research, I use Scrivener to organize it all.Scrivener is an incredibly complex and full-featured writing tool; tons of novelists and scriptwriters use it. It has about a zillion features, though I only use a tiny smidgen of them. Mostly I use it as a lightweight database: I create a new project and, every time I hit upon a piece of research I want to save, I make a new note in Scrivener — clipping a paragraph or two from the document or interview, or maybe a screengrab from a dataviz, and then writing a couple of my own thoughts about it. After a few days or months or weeks (or years, if it’s a book) of reporting, I’ll have anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand notes.What I love about Scrivener is the search is very, very fast. Nonfiction writing requires you to be able to quickly re-look at your notes — and to quickly re-find something. Because Scrivener is storing all its info on your own hard drive, it’s lightning fast to find things. For me, this is absolutely crucial.It’s also a pretty good word processor, so when time comes to write, I’ll create a new note and write the entire piece in it.The Windows and Mac versions are $49, and, for me, worth it. Tragically there’s no native Linux app.While most of my note-taking happens in Scrivener, I use Notion to organize ideas.I’ve often said that my job as a freelance magazine writer is not really to write, and it’s not even to report; it’s to find new stories and ideas that ought to be reported and written about. This is typically harder — much harder — than actually reporting and writing a story. The latter is a project with a clearly defined goal (“here’s subject X; write a piece about it”). The former is open-ended and much less defined: “What are some fascinating things my editors haven’t heard about yet, that would appeal to tons of readers, and are also incredibly interesting to me?” As I’ve written before, easily 50% of all my work hours are devoted to prospecting for new story ideas.So I’m prospecting constantly, incessantly. Even while working on a current assignment, I keep one eye peeled and one ear open for possible future story ideas. (When I’m done the piece I’m currently working on, my editor’s question will be: Cool, what’s next? And I want to have something.)I generally use Notion to jot down possible ideas. I have different Notion pages for different publications or different areas of interest, and when I hit upon an interesting idea I write a quick bullet-point about it, dropping in links to any relevant online materials or research.I do a ton of interviews — six to ten for a short column, scores for a long magazine article, and well into the hundreds for a book.The easiest way I’ve found to record them is to simply use Voice Memos on my Iphone. For a F2F interview, the audio quality is typically excellent. If I’m interviewing someone on Zoom, I’ll play the audio out my laptop speakers and record it using my Iphone. Even with that speaker → Iphone loop, the quality is still usually very good. In the past, I’ve tried using apps that capture Zoom audio internally but they failed often enough that I can’t risk it. By having my Iphone sitting there next to my laptop speakers, I can visually see that it’s working.Once I’ve recorded an interview, I instantly upload it to …I generally create a new Dropbox folder for each story, into which I dump any research PDFs and all audio of interviews. It’s super reliable and syncs well with my phone, so I can dump stuff straight off my phone to the folder, and view stuff on the go.Not rocket science here, but a crucial part of my flow.When I’m transcribing those audio interviews? I generally use …Trint is one of those auto-transcription services. There are a ton of them out there now, and many are cheaper than Trint: It’s $70 a month for an all-you-can-eat account, which is what I have.But I transcribe a ton of interviews: Every month at least ten or fifteen hour-long ones, and sometimes dozens. If I were to pay to have those transcribed by a transcription service, it’d cost me anywhere from $1,000 to several thousand dollars each month.What distinguishes Trint from the other AI-transcription tools I’ve tried is that it includes a very slick editor (in the browser) for listening to, and cleaning up, the transcriptions. Typically the AI only gets things about 90% correct. But the editor lets you rapidly scrub through the text, clicking on messed-up clauses to hear the audio at that point, then fixing it. There are tons of key-commands too for letting you whip through the text, zipping a few seconds back to re-hear something that’s hard to fix, or speeding up and slowing down playback.When I’m doing F2F interviews, or making marginalia notes in paper books, I like using a pencil.And not just any pencils! I have a fetish these gorgeous Blackwing pencils. A famous model from the early 20th century that vanished after the original manufacturer fell apart, they’ve been rebooted and are now available all over the place. What makes them lovely is the buttery-soft and ink-dark soft lead, which make notes fun to write and crisply legible.The downside is that because the lead is so soft, it gets dull very quickly, so you’re constantly sharpening it. This doesn’t bother me too much; I enjoy the little scritch-scritch-scritch ritual and the strangely intoxicating smell of pencil-wood it releases.The long-point sharpener, like the name suggests, produces the sharpest point I’ve ever seen on a pencil.I read a ton of nonfiction books, and I’m frequently dipping into historical research that goes back to the 19th century and before.My secret weapon for nonfiction book-research is Scribd, the digital-book service. It costs about $12 a month, and has an astonishingly huge amount of scholarly and trade nonfiction books in its library. When I hear of an interesting work of nonfiction, a majority of the time it’s on Scribd, and so within mere minutes of learning of the work’s existence, I’m deep in the first chapter. Since quality nonfiction and scholarly books have the highest research-to-page ratio of almost any media, this is an absolute gold-mine.The same thing goes for the Internet Archive’s trove of scanned books. It’s patchier, but still, there’s a ton of amazing material I use all the time. Either the books I find are in the public domain, or they’re under copyright but the Archive lets one person at a time virtually “check out” the book for an hour. I do this at least several times a week, for the same intellectual instant gratification that Scribd provides: If I merely hear of a title, I’m reading it seconds later. It allows for an amazing velocity of research.When I’m doing research, I’m very often cutting and pasting chunks of text from web site and PDFs into Scrivener. The problem is, a lot of this text is formatted oddly, with strange line breaks.Cleantext is a Mac app that can quickly clean up nearly any odd formatting, so when I paste it into my notes it’s in straightforward paragraphs. It’s dead simple, but when I’m on a big reading/research tear, I’ll use this thing dozens of times an hour.I’m sure something like this has to exist for Windows and Linux, too; probably on the web. I am too lazy to research this right now.I don’t really use it for writing. But I very often file my drafts to editors using Google Docs, and then they edit it in Docs and we do different revisions that way.Docs has hilariously wretched search and the folder system is such an ungainly brutalist nightmare that I’d never use it for serious research. But for collaborative remote editing of a document, it can’t be beat.(Working in Google Docs also makes sure the NSA has a copy of all my drafts, too, which is, like, convenient I guess? For them, anyway.)These are just the tools, mind you. This only scratches the surfaces of the techniques, which are a lot more complex: I.e. how I organize a piece of reporting and writing.I’m sloowwwwly building a series of articles on this. You can read the collection thus far here.(Enjoyed this? Then why not grab that trackpad, locate the “clap” button, and cut loose. It’s good for up to 50 clicks!

Not found.,Thomas Smith,Dec 9,https://tomsmith585.medium.com/chatgpt-is-having-a-thomas-edison-moment-8342dd70d2bd?source=home---------2------------------0----------,"ChatGPT is blowing up. Twitter is inundated with screenshots of the app, coding sites like Stack Overflow are already banning answers produced with it, and over 1 million people have played with it. It’s a sensation.As a professional AI researcher, I wouldn’t have called that. ChatGPT is trained specifically to act as a chat bot, but fundamentally it’s using the same GPT-3 technology that’s been available for over two years now.What ChatGPT 3 demonstrates — moreso than impressive technology — is the crucial role that access plays in making breakthroughs truly usable. By packaging GPT-3 in a way that normal people can use, OpenAI has finally made people sit up and realize the incredible power of today’s AI.This is nothing new; we think of Thomas Edison as the inventor of the lightbulb, not because he actually invented it, but because he successfully brought it to market and turned it into something that normal people could understand.That will be a trend in the AI industry going forward; the companies that make using AI as easy as possible will be the ones that thrive.Most of today’s impressive AI systems are built on massive language models. These language models are trained on, essentially, all of the text humans have created over the last 6,000+ years.GPT-3 ate 8 billion pages of text, almost every book ever published, and all of Wikipedia. It spat out an AI system that exhibits properties of general intelligence and can do everything from writing sea shanties to solving coding problems.None of that is new. I started beta testing GPT-3 in 2020, and the fundamentals of the system have been around for much longer than that.Interestingly, tools like GPT-3 have been baked into all kinds of apps without anyone really knowing. Many of the AI writing assistants that writers here on this platform either fawn over or scream about are just fancy wrappers around GPT-3.Likewise, lots of utilitarian text on the Internet — think summaries of a restaurant’s menu or little blurbs about what you’ll find in a new city — are already written by AI systems like GPT-3. You’ve probably consumed text written by GPT-3 and not even known about it.So why is ChatGPT such a sensation if the technology behind it has been out for a while?It’s because ChatGPT makes that technology incredibly accessible. The chatbot is free to use, and every day people can sign up and interact with it as if they’re texting a friend. It’s not that ChatGPT does anything fundamentally new. It just does it in a way that normal people can access and thus be blown away by.Allowing for that level of accessibility is not easy. OpenAI’s Sam Altman shared on Twitter that opening up ChatGPT to the general public resulted in some eye-watering computing costs.Each chat sent to the system reportedly costs “low digit cents” to process. If 1 million people are using the system, OpenAI is probably sinking several hundred thousand dollars a day into keeping ChatGPT operating, with no immediate business case.Academic researchers and the other people who’ve made the fundamental breakthroughs behind technologies like GPT-3 simply couldn’t afford that. Without the resources to put into making the technology accessible, the tech can’t make it out into the real world.That dynamic has existed for a long time. The history of science is littered with situations where a researcher developed a breakthrough idea, only to be shoved aside by the entrepreneur or visionary who made that idea easily accessible to the public.We think of Thomas Edison as the inventor of the lightbulb. But really, it was inventors like Vasilij Petrov, Thomas Wright, and Joseph Swan who made the first lightbulbs. Edison’s genius was in electrifying public buildings, building power plants and wiring, and otherwise making the technology visible and accessible to everyday people.Edison probably lost a ton of money pulling off dramatic stunts, like building a full power plant just to light the home of wealthy financier JP Morgan, the New York Stock Exchange, and several newspapers’ headquarters.But once people saw the advantage of electric lights, they needed them for their own homes. By making the technology accessible and easily visible — even at a great personal cost — Edison had unlocked a market for it that proved wildly profitable.In the AI space, something similar is now brewing. ChatGPT shows that developing breakthrough technology won’t lead to cultural change if that technology is restricted to the lab or even to the high-powered servers of B2B clients.For technology as groundbreaking as AI to make it out into the real world, it has to engage the imaginations of everyday people. People need to play with it directly — and see its revolutionary power — before the tech will truly impact the world.As the field continues to evolve, it will be the companies who continue to make the technology widely accessible — even at tremendous cost — that will ultimately succeed.OpenAI had better get used to those eye-watering compute fees. They’re building a revolution, and revolutions are expensive.Related Reading:"
"Why we fight: Ukraine, Russia, and the future world order",Marta Khomyn,Nov 3,https://medium.com/@marta.khomyn/why-we-fight-ukraine-russia-and-the-future-world-order-cd243a08a4bb?source=home---------61------------------0----------,"I am reading a story from the front lines, by Artem Chekh, a Ukrainian writer (and now a soldier), and something inside me cracks open at the raw reality of war.The reality of death, courage, and duty is much different from the patriotic fast-food we’ve been fed at school. There’s no room for pathos, window-dressing, staged heroism. Death strips us all bare. We emerge pixel-ized.The blind spots of the Western discourse on Russia and UkraineFor the last month or so, since returning from Ukraine, I’ve hardly written anything. Not because I’ve faced a sudden writer’s block (for that, one has to be a writer — I’m not). Rather, I’m speechless when I see a widening chasm between the mainstream media’s petty interpretations of the Russia-Ukraine war, and the far-reaching historical consequences this war will have globally, for generations to come.From Elon Musk’s Russia appeasement to an ever-louder US left, eager to set limits on the US support of Ukraine ahead of the midterm elections, to China’s Xi Jinping tightening the screws on his already tight grip of power (possibly for life), — the configuration at the global chessboard is one of crossroads: between freedom and autocracy, between the rules-based global order and the law of the jungle, between humanity and cold-blooded profiteering.Republicans are likely to win majority in the upcoming US midterm elections, which calls into question the extent of the future US military aid. The Republican party has been sending mixed signals on how much aid to send to Ukraine, with some far-right commentators openly parroting the Russian narrative that “Russia is actually fighting the West / NATO”.The Republican argument for scaling down the support for Ukraine, — on the basis of fiscal frugality, — is misguided. Economically, the US spends just 0.25% of GDP on the aid to Ukraine (for comparison, Estonia spends 1% of GDP). Politically, scaling back Ukraine’s support package serves neither US national interests, nor the global interest of political and economic stability.The GOP is also ignoring the plain cause-and-effect relation: weaker Ukraine means emboldened totalitarian regimes — from Russia to Iran to China, and almost a century of lost progress towards human rights and greater global stability.The right answer to “How much military aid to send to Ukraine” is simple: “As much as it takes to restore the integrity of Ukraine’s borders.” Any other answer would undermine the commitment to the very global order the democratic world stands for.This past month, there’s been an awful lot of know-it-all opining on “what we should or shouldn’t do” to avert an all-out war between the nuclear powers. A simplistic assertion by Elon Musk, and others without any background on history of Ukraine and Russia, international relations, or game theory—is that averting WW III is a matter of conceding occupied Ukraine’s territories to Russia. This assertion is wrong.Giving in to nuclear blackmail makes nuclear war much more likely. It would significantly increase the chance of any of the other nuclear powers taking advantage of their nuclear status to achieve their political aims. It would also encourage non-nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons for deterrence. Ultimately, it would open the Pandora’s box of global nuclear proliferation.History is a series of “repeated games” — a game theory lingo for facing the same strategic decision multiple times, as opposed to a “one-shot” game, in which counterparts interact once only. However much Putin would like to scare the world into believing this is a one-shot game, — it’s not. That’s why for the more militarily powerful Western allies, it’s irrational to give in to nuclear blackmail by a militarily weaker Russia.Russia threatens to use nukes against Ukraine, not against the Western allies. A likely Western response would be a non-nuclear one (one can successfully use conventional weapons to “take out every Russian conventional force on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea”).Common sense — and its mathematically rigorous counterpart, game theory — suggest that Russian threats are primarily a psychological weapon. Giving in to these threats is neither rational nor peace-forming.Against the backdrop of increasingly polarised US and European politics, it’s perhaps not surprising to hear pro-Russian arguments from both the far-right and far-left. The often-cited reason against increasing the military aid to Ukraine is simply “we’ve got domestic problems to take care of”. Inflation, for one, is top of mind in any developed country right now.The irony, of course, is that Russia’s war in Ukraine is a major driver of the very thing western voters are so weary of — the rising prices of food and fuel. Worse still, dozens of developing countries are at risk of hunger after Russia’s recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain trade deal.The twisted logic in “just stop the war, regardless of the cost to Ukraine” — is that it assumes a long list of Russia-generated problems will simply evaporate once Ukraine surrenders. If one thinks cheap Russian energy will materialise the minute Ukraine is sold out by the allies, one has to revisit the history of two decades of Russian geopolitical adventures — from Caucasus to Transnistria. Russian imperial adventurism is far from limited to Ukraine. Failing to “tame the bear” now, Europe will have to deal with an unlimited supply of geopolitical and energy trouble for decades to come.Should I look beyond food and fuel in my list of reasons to support Ukraine? I’m hardly convinced that world leaders would act out of humanitarian, legal, or moral obligation. Still, let me present these more high-flying arguments in brief.Most western politicking on Ukraine overlooks the dire reality on the ground. Everyone in Ukraine — from Lviv to Zaporizhzhia — would have experienced living without electricity, heat, and water since October 10th. Russia has been destroying the Ukrainian energy system on a daily basis. Meanwhile, civilians have been targeted by Russian missiles programmers since the very start of the war.A cynical observer might argue that it’s human nature — to overlook the moral obligations to strangers far away, and favour helping those close to us. The problem with this argument, of course, is that morality and ethics are universal, and geographically blind.And finally, there is the legal argument. It’s in the infamous Budapest memorandum. In 1994, Ukraine gave up its (third largest in the world) nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia (the irony!), United Kingdom, and the United States. Among other things, the Memorandum prohibits the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine.Persistence: an under-appreciated force in historyThis war has made me a keen student of history. History has taught me to put my faith in persistence rather than in chance.Ukrainians will fight on. We fight to live, not to merely survive.P.S. Thanks for reading! I keep my posts free, but here’s a quick way to say thanks — donate to Return Alive Foundation, United24 or the KSE Foundation, and #StandWithUkraine! This is the best way to invest in freedom and ensure we live in a safe world."

My kids designed a game and this is what I learned,Ben Snyder,Nov 10,https://uxdesign.cc/my-kids-designed-a-game-and-this-is-what-i-learned-86a261eca324?source=home---------32------------------0----------,"My 9-year-old son, Owen, had long ago been indoctrinated by the entrepreneurial spirit. I don’t remember how it all started, but now he owns stock and has been saving up to buy a hotel. So, yeah.Anyhow, I wasn’t surprised when he came to me last month with an idea for a game. With excited eyes, he explained the mechanics of a math-based learning game and how he wanted to sell it on an app store.We have a habit of discussing business ideas so it wasn’t until later that evening that I realized to myself, “goshdarnit, we could actually do this— it’s kinda what I do for a living.”I thought I’d share how it went and some of the anecdotal observations I made along the way — skip to the end if you want to hear about our process.I’m guessing that thousands of years ago, the colors in our environment told us something about what was poisonous or delicious. And now, it seems, we’re naturally skilled at translating that to CSS.In their CSS experimentation, the kids initially landed on the brightest candy-looking colors for things like buttons and inputs.When I explained to Owen that many folks might not be able to read rainbow-colored buttons, he argued that it was his game and he preferred the gradients.I eventually convinced him to switch by explaining more people could use the game with higher contrast labels (and thus, more money if we were charging)… I might add “using business metrics to influence a 9-year-old” to my resume!My son designed his game first and then we went through the development process, finally demoing it to great applause from the family. Afterward, I sat down with my daughter and began the same exercise.Both products turned out to be similarly named side-scrolling race games with multiple characters vying for a finish line based on how fast they could accomplish a specific learning-based task.Although the games share the same general format, the concepts are individually interesting with unique illustrations and narratives. Using the same general blueprint sped up our development cycle on the second game while still allowing us to deliver a new, engaging experience.My daughter was influenced by what was, at that point in time, the status quo she was familiar with. This is great for incremental innovation but probably restrained her from truly leapfrogging the competition (her brother).How many times have you and your team discussed the time it would take to build something the “right way” versus getting something to market quickly? Depending on your answer, you might not be surprised that I had this same conversation with a 2nd grader.My career has been spent building platforms that can scale as customers or the business itself grows. For this reason, I attempted to shift the project from us building two ad hoc games to a platform that could host more games in the future.That is to say, while the kids wanted to get their games to market as quickly as possible to share with their friends, I wanted to take the extra time to make something that would scale more efficiently over time.It’s been a few exciting weeks watching the kids anticipate the launch of their projects. The games are far from perfect, but we’re proud of what we accomplished as a team.Visit SimpleKidGames.com on a desktop web browser to give the games a try. These don’t work very well on mobile devices yet, so your mileage may vary depending on if you’re on an iPad-sized phone or not.The MVP is out, and now I have to jump into our post-release retro and discuss the cost-benefit of spending 20% of our time on tech debt versus shipping a new game to the platform.If after reading this, you feel compelled to do something similar with your children, this is how we went about executing our plan. The kid’s interest in computer science has grown and I’d highly recommend this for any family.The games use pretty rudimentary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which you can see at the repository here. It’s all vanilla code that can be walked through with a mildly interested and semi-savvy child.None of this process or output was perfect, but we’re happy with the result and the kids have something very unique to share with their friends and classmates — good luck!"
Why Your Team Needs a Weekly Metrics Review,Julie Zhuo,Nov 30,https://joulee.medium.com/why-your-team-needs-a-weekly-metrics-review-dcc9cce7ac3c?source=home---------4------------------0----------,"A few weeks ago in our Manifesto for the Data Informed, one of the five beliefs presented was Company-wide familiarity with metrics rather than outsourcing to ‘data people.’Immediately, we were pummeled with questions: Does this really matter? Is this a realistic expectation? How can an organization achieve this? So for our next few posts, we’ll deep dive into how to make this lofty aspiration practical.As with anything else in life — whether people, languages or customs — there is no shortcut to gaining familiarity; the only way is through direct and frequent exposure.With data, most teams inherently understand this — that is why dashboards are built and links are passed around and we are all reminded to “please bookmark it and check it often.”Unfortunately, unless your job title includes the word data, the practice of loading said bookmark does not frequently arise to the top of your to-do list, even if you really truly do think data is important! Thus begins the great death spiral of dashboards — because they go unused, they become unmaintained. Because they are unmaintained, when you finally have a need to look at them, they’re broken and useless.This is why data-informed teams rely on practices other than sheer will to create data familiarity. The big three are 1. weekly metrics reviews, 2. weekly insight reports, and 3. insights reviews.In this installment, we’ll tackle one of the single most impactful practices of building a data-informed team: the weekly metrics review.A weekly metrics review is a synchronous team meeting to review the key metrics for a scaling, post-PMF product with all functional team members present — ie, PM, engineering, design, operations. This type of review can (and should!) happen at the executive level, with the CEO and C-level executives, and recurse down to individual product teams.A weekly metrics review should be short and sweet (think 5–15 minutes, typically at the start of a regular team meeting) and led by the data person who walks the group through the key metrics for your collective area of work (e.g. new user growth, revenue, conversion rates, tickets resolved).The group should examine how key metrics have progressed over the past few weeks, ideally by looking at a series of time-series line charts. The presenter can also prepare a few key segments to review, for example if a certain type of user, platform, or market is strategically important to the team, or if the team has launched something that impacts a particular segment (like a new feature in a test market).It’s best to keep the meeting lightweight. Preparation should be easy, ideally no more than 30 minutes. Many great metrics reviews simply start with screenshots of dashboards. The data person shouldn’t have to have all the answers at their finger tips (why did active users spike two weeks ago?). It’s fine to circle back with an answer later.Metrics reviews are unlike product reviews or decision meetings; the point is a shared understanding of how the team is progressing towards its goals, not making decisions or creating action items.This is an unusual proposition, especially when ambitious team are (rightfully!) wary of wasting time in meetings. After reading an article like this and trying out this style of meeting, you may find yourself wondering: Is this meeting actually helping us accomplish anything? It’s common for the weekly metrics review to get cancelled, demoted to an e-mail update, or become the spawning ground for long lists of follow-up questions just so the group feels they did something.And yet, we argue that familiarity with the impact of the team’s work is in of itself an important enough goal to create a synchronous cadence around. Because we work in a team environment, having shared context across different functions is critical. The ideal outcome of a metrics review is that each person develops a shared understanding of the following questions:Few things focus a group as effectively as seeing a chart of week-over-week progress inching towards a goal target. The ritual of doing this together forces the room to confront questions like Are we likely to hit our goal? and Is our recent work having the impact we expected?, which ultimately ladder to the Holy Grail question: Is our strategy working?If it were obvious what a team should do, then success would be guaranteed. Alas, this is not how the world works.Creative teamwork is an infinite treadmill of trial and error — come up with ideas you hypothesize will lead to a desired outcome, then do the work to see if you’re right. When you take account of the results is when you learn to hone your skills.Take an example: let’s say we spent three months shipping Feature X. We might then have a decision to make, should we work on Xv2 next? Simply looking at X’s results in isolation isn’t enough to answer this question; we must consider this relative to other possibilities — what about improving features A, B or C? When we take the time to regularly reflect on the impact of our work through metric reviews, we build towards a richer knowledge of what really drives our business.Put another way, a major benefit of implementing weekly metrics reviews is that everyone on the team will improve their product thinking. For example, a designer will be less likely to propose an important button on the bottom of the page if he knows there’s roughly a 2x decrease in CTR compared to the top. An engineer will be more vigilant about holding the line on performance as she implements a new feature if she’s aware that snappy loading is a huge driver of usage.Every business has some level of volatility and seasonality. For example, enterprise apps are more used during weekdays, while video games are played more on weekends. Say you expect Januarys to be worse than Decembers for your business, and as predicted, you see a January dip. How big would the dip have to be for you to be worried that something is wrong?Familiarity with the normal rhythms of your business is essential to quickly identifying when you might need to take action because something is amiss, or when there’s likely to be an error in your measurement. For example, if a team member reports that a recent experiment led to a 20% increase in Key Metric X, but you know X to be extremely difficult to move, you would be suspicious and probe further. Over time, a well-honed understanding of what is normal leads to better forecasting and future planning.Done well, the practice of weekly metric reviews creates a shared understanding of progress, hones a team’s strategic chops, and enables faster detection of issues.But beware one of the secret killers of metric reviews — too many follow-up questions.To be clear, asking questions is an important part of building familiarity, and good questions can lead to important new discoveries. However, not all questions are worth the effort it takes to answer them. It’s easy to rattle off a dozen questions just because you can and you’re a curious person, but you may unwittingly be creating hours of work in chasing follow-ups. Instead, aim to ask questions that are likely to lead to a change in decision.A good litmus test for whether a data question is worth asking is this: What is my estimate for the most optimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? Conversely, What is my estimate for the most pessimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? If your actions for both questions are the same, you have a question that’s probably not worth answering.As an example, consider the question: What is our worst-performing country, and how much worse is it doing compared to an average country?If your pessimistic answer is Honestly I’m not going to do anything with this information unless it’s one of our Top 10 countries, then having someone spend a bunch of time querying for the result may not be worth it. (A better question might be: Which Top 10 country is performing the worst this quarter?)Practically speaking, starting the habit of metric reviews isn’t always easy, bacause you need convince other functions that it’s worth their time. If you are the data representative, start by discussing the idea with the person who has overall accountability for the team’s work and would be most interested in tracking progress and aligning towards a common goal. This could be the CEO, a general manager (ie head of operations, head of sales), or a product leader (ie PM, engineering lead, etc.)If you yourself are the directly accountable individual, then propose the idea of a metrics review with your data partner. If both of you agree, then ask the rest of the team to commit to trying it for at least a quarter. Tacking the practice to the start of a pre-existing team meeting also reduces friction.Your metrics review doesn’t have to be fully comprehensive to start. Consider beginning with a 10-minute slot every other week. The data representative should be prepared to direct the agenda and remind everyone of the goals in the early sessions (This is our main goal metric… I am showing you this segment because… I am showing you this related metric because…) Use the first few sessions to get feedback about the right set of metrics and cuts to look at. Remember: it’s better to start small and add over time than to overwhelm the group by flipping through dozens of charts and numbers. You can always follow up with a short e-mail summarizing what got discussed, with links for further exploration.Stay tuned for the sequel: why your team should have insights report and insights reviews.Past posts in this series:Manifesto for the Data-Informed

The Unlikely Encounter That Made Me Confront My Male Fragility,Matthew R. Manning,"Sep 3, 2019",https://humanparts.medium.com/miigwech-fc422b2f3c?source=home---------23------------------0----------,"drive a couple of blocks and the streets get darker. As I near my Powderhorn home, domestic boulevards overtake the lights of the small commercial center in my rearview. It’s just past 11:30 p.m.Outside of downtown, it’s hard to escape the modesty of urban life in Minneapolis. This is no concrete jungle, more like an overgrown prairie with lakes and sidewalks. But all that is frozen over now — winter holds its grudges.I am trailing two cars, homeward bound, with no real sense of urgency. Before long, about a half-block in front of me, two objects appear in the street. These are not cars, but something smaller. I’m not sure what I’m looking at. It’s snowing again, and the flurry blurs focus like a pixelated television. Foot hovering over the brakes, I keep driving, prepared for any sudden stops.As I get closer, I discern two figures. They walk urgently, weaving back and forth through the passing vehicles. I inch closer to the pedestrians, careful not to make the wrong move, especially on these Minneapolis streets where cars glide for yards on carpets of black ice.The vehicles ahead of me swerve slightly and honk, avoid the first person, and drive away. As I get closer, I see that it’s a woman. She rushes toward my car, waving her left hand in the air. Her gaze meets mine as I pass. I see her eyes, wide and dark — they scream with fright, like prey.I swerve out of the way, too, her body glancing past my driver’s side window. Despite the cold, she’s only wearing a tank top and jeans. She’s also holding the right side of her head, as if in pain. Her mouth is open, her face stretched sideways in what looks like exhaustion.She’s tall, maybe five feet, 10 inches. Her skin is light brown, and she has messy, dark hair and deep-set eyes. My guess is she’s Native American, given her presence in this part of South Minneapolis. Most of our streets and lakes — hell, even the state — are named after Native peoples. Most now live in homes scattered around these blocks, but some are in the nearby projects off Cedar Avenue.Then I pass the second figure, a man, looking possessed. He’s short, with piercing eyes, gritted teeth, and persistence in every step. His energy is almost otherworldly, like the rabid dog I once saw in Sierra Leone. Unlike his companion, he does not glance my way or notice cars on the road. He’s fixed on the woman, walking rapidly in her direction with what appears to be a thick wool sweater in his right hand.I drive past him, struggling to sync this information in my mind. I remind myself to look forward to avoid a crash. Mere seconds ago, I assumed these were drunken college kids playing in the streets. Now I understand otherwise.The drivers in front of me continue on as if they’ve seen nothing. Selfishly, I want to do the same. I want to go home, to sleep. And I try. But after another half block, I pull over and take a heavy breath. I’m conflicted. Do you want to do this? Favoring instinct over reason, I turn the corner and circle the block.When I approach again, the woman is crossing the four-way intersection, heading north down Bloomington Avenue. The man is still following her from the other side, some 20 yards behind. I speed up, cut between them, and turn right to follow the woman. With the man in my rearview, I drive up several yards to where the woman continues her seemingly desperate escape.I watch for cars coming from the other direction, drive up the middle of the street, and pull up next to the woman. She darts away from the car at first, likely assuming I’m trying to pass her. Instead, I roll down the window to ask if she’s alright.“Ma’am, are you okay?” Of course she’s not.She jumps, startled by the voice. Though the night is quiet, my mind is loud. I question my decision to intercede. Is this wise? I’m a man, too, after all. A Black man at that.“Ma’am! Are you alright?”The woman comes to her senses and yells through tears and melted snow, “No, no! Please help! Can I have a ride?”“Of course.”I’m startled by my confidence, and suddenly wary of a potential trap or ploy. Yet I lean over and try to open the passenger door. It’s frozen shut.I glance in the rearview mirror, anxious that our brief moments of stillness have let the man draw close. And they have. His steps quicken as he sees the woman prepare to enter the car. Looking toward him, her hands fumble the handle a couple more times.“Pull hard!” I yell, my heart beating in my ears.After two or three seconds that feel like minutes, she gives a final tug that cracks the seal of ice. She opens the door and the car is instantly overcome by frigid air, its warmth suctioned away. The woman slams the door and I drive. The man, about to reach the car, begins to run. Each footstep is a stammer, hands flailing in the air as he fades from view.The initial silence is accompanied by the woman’s heavy, unsteady breathing. The passenger side window fogs up as she catches her breath. From the corner of my eye, I see her many colorful tattoos. Her facial features are pronounced, her cheekbones high and wide, chin low, almost triangular.Goosebumps climb her bare arms as if the cold air is catching up to her shock. Shaking, she leans forward for a few moments, her face in her hands. Her right hand combs through her hair but quickly pulls away as she curses under her breath. A large wound irritates the side of her scalp.I again ask my senseless question. “Are you alright?” I feel at a loss.She says nothing at first, tries only to steady her breath. Then, tucking her head into her lap, she starts repeating to herself, “No, no, no, no…”I heed her energy. I say nothing, sensing she’s not ready for conversation. Instead, I blast the heat and keep driving past the turnoff for my home.Not knowing where I’m going, I ask her again, timidly. “Ma’am, are you alright?” She instantly bursts into tears. I add “I’m so sorry. Is there somewhere I can take you?”Slow to comfort, she begins to open up. She tells me more than I asked for, as if processing it for herself. She tells me the man, a friend, was on a drunken binge at a local bar. Then he got loud and handsy with her. When she tried to get him to stop, he became violent, pushing and hitting her in front of the other patrons. When staff tried to interfere, she ran out the front door into the cold air. He began chasing her, and he didn’t stop until the moment we drove away.In the scramble, she tells me, he stripped her of her sweater and shirt, where she’d pocketed her wallet and phone. She was down to her white tank top and ripped jeans.“No one would stop and help.” Her voice is deep. “It felt like I was running for 30 minutes.”The thought of the man trailing her sickens me. She complains about her aching head, a small patch of hair pulled from her scalp in the scuffle. We’re seeing each other now, eye to eye. I empathize as best I can, knowing I’ve never been in her position.“God bless you,” she says, but I call my worth into question. Her words are genuine and grateful, but I receive them with shame. There were so many times I never stopped.“Is there somewhere I can take you? I’ll drive you wherever.”She’s uncertain of where to go. While she thinks about my question, I ask her if it’s alright to stop at my house, now two miles behind us.“Maybe I have an old sweater or something I can give you.”She agrees and I circle back. When I arrive home it’s nearing midnight. I park the car and hesitate for a moment with my hands on the keys. I want to keep the car warm for her, but the cynic in me wonders if it’s smart to leave her alone in my car and with my keys. Again trusting instinct over reason, I detach my house key from the chain and rush inside, the car still on.“I’ll be right back.”My mutt of a dog, Franklin, jumps to his feet as I enter and follows me to my bedroom on the opposite side of the house. He trots behind me, long nails clacking on wooden floorboards like a miniature horse. I don’t entertain him like I normally would. Instead, I burrow through my closet to secure the thickest, warmest sweatshirt I can find. It’s the one my grandfather — Opa, my family calls him — gave me when I turned 18. It’s too big for me, but that’s why I like it. It makes me feel protected, hidden. It’s the same reason I always wear a hat. I hesitate again but swallow my creeping regrets. Before heading back out, I grab the $25 that rests in the top drawer of my dresser.As I walk out of the bedroom, I pass myself in the mirror hanging from the closet door. I look tired. My withered brown boots, khaki pants, leather coat, and baseball cap only seem to mask what rests beneath. The growing beard on my face makes me look like my father, with whom I’ve just reconnected. My eyes are dark and cumbersome, and the endless white of winter has turned my brown skin pale.I peer down at Franklin in the mirror, who sits at my feet and cocks his head, silken eyes amused by the look of me. I chuckle and return to the car.When I see the vehicle still parked outside my house, I silently reprimand myself for doubting her. I hand her the sweatshirt and the money and she timidly accepts both, putting on the sweatshirt right away. It fits her better than it fit me.“Have you thought about where you’d like to go?” The energy in the car has steadied. It’s calm, collected. “Seriously,” I add, “You name it.”She directs me to a house a couple of miles away, where a girlfriend lives. She calls her friend on my phone, confirming they’re there, and we drive off once again. On the way, she asks me my name. I’m reminded that we’ve shared this entire experience without knowing each other’s names.“Matthew.”“Oh, I love that name. That’s one of my favorite names.”I smile and I accept it. I don’t care if she’s being sincere or not. “Thanks. And you?”“My name is Mary.”I pause, shocked by her response.“That’s my mom’s name,” I tell her. She can hear the excitement in my voice.“No way,” she says through a smile. I picture my mom, likely asleep on her bed or the couch with the TV on and a blanket half draped over her body, aging gracefully in her quaint uptown apartment.I learn a lot about Mary in those two miles to her friend’s house. She was released from jail two weeks prior, some days before Thanksgiving. She was caught selling weed two years ago, and they locked her up. She talks about the difficulty of putting all the pieces back into place — calls it “a puzzle.”“It’s really hard when you get out,” she says. “Everything feels like a trap. It feels like everyone I know has turned their backs on me.”I can feel her weight, and I try to lighten the mood. “How was your Thanksgiving?”Mary’s face lights up. She tells me about her “tiny” new apartment in the Phillips neighborhood, and how she hosted seven members of her large family. Her energy has completely changed. Her voice is higher now, and she’s sitting almost straight up, her hands animating every word. I’m touched by her warm spirit, as if she’s transferring it to me.“Do you have any children?” I ask.“Eight,” she says proudly.Eight? My surprise is honest. That’s a hell of a lot of children. I’m reminded of my own five siblings — three of whom I don’t know.“Were they around for Thanksgiving?” I ask, digging deeper.She begins to break down again, finds it difficult to muster words. I don’t know her, but I feel like I do. I feel like I’m conversing with a different iteration of my spiritual and emotional self — one less privileged, but similarly broken and dejected.She tells me she lost all eight children to the foster care system, and that this most recent arrest was not her first time in trouble with the law. There was no father around to support the kids, so the state took them away. I think of my father and his children, each shaped in some way by his absence, though to a lesser extreme. Mary brought the case to court and fought for custody, but ultimately lost.“I tried so hard… I did everything I could,” she says. I believe her.Her friend is waiting behind the front door screen when we arrive, the light behind her casting a large shadow on her front lawn. I slow the car to a halt, uncertain about how to end what feels like a scripted drama. But Mary turns to me, leans in for a half-hug in Opa’s oversized sweatshirt, gently grabs my hand, and looks me in the eyes.“Miigwech.” She pronounces it “meeg-way-ch.”I must look puzzled. She laughs a warm laugh and says it again, “Miigwech. It means ‘thank you’ in my language. I’m Ojibwe.”“Wow…” All I can muster before she leaves is, “Thank you.”think about Mary often. I wonder where she is, what she’s doing, and if she ever got her kids back. It took me months to begin chronicling this experience, and six years to publish it. There was too much to process, too much to learn and grow from. That hour with Mary shaped me (and continues to shape me) in a way no other has. The experience reflected all I’d buried deep in my own life. It laid bare the pains of childhood and trials of adulthood, the fragmentation of family, the patient mending of my spirit.For one, she reminded me of my mom, who was also a survivor of senseless violence and abuse at the hands of a man — my father, in particular. My mother suffered her own wounds, her own bruises. It took me years to look at her without invoking her pain. Growing up as her son and her support system, I was overcome with guilt. I was away, struggling through my first couple months at DePaul University, while the abuse happened. As a result, I processed her experience selfishly, focusing on my own guilt over not being more present for her. It took time to see past the traumas she endured, and to see her not as a victim but as everything she deemed more important: a mother, sister, partner, friend, and entrepreneur.It took time for me to understand that just because my mother doesn’t talk about her pain anymore doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel it and think about it, or that she’s not fundamentally changed by it. Seeing my father, however cordial they might be now, is a bitter reminder of the ways male fragility tore down trust and a familial bedrock three decades in the making.Second, my experience that winter night forced me to confront my male fragility. In the man who chased Mary, I saw the same wild and turbulent eyes I’d often seen in my father. And I recognized in them both something all too familiar: a man so afraid of his own shadow that he takes his pain out on others. A man so incapable of processing emotions that he either implodes or explodes. And this scared the hell out of me, knowing with all my sensitivities and emotions and expressiveness, I still felt caged by the toxic ways boys are conditioned to subdue hurt.I feared the power in my hands. That a man as meek and jovial as my father could turn so calloused. That in time, one could become so repressed that their very temperament changes. I hated admitting that the discontent and anger I felt toward my father was not much unlike the anger that changed him. That our two-year severance was not dissimilar from the one between him and his stepfather, who’d abused his mother. How cyclical and generational our pain.My encounter with Mary also forced me to reckon with my complicity as a leader and philanthropist. I thought of when I stayed home instead of participating in the local protest. When I denied the gaze of someone less privileged peddling for food on the street. Comfort was a reliable and convenient choice, not a moral one. I engaged in coddling behaviors, like seeking a male friend’s atonement before protecting the peace and well-being of the harmed. I wasn’t nobler than the average person. I was merely thrust, uncomfortably, past the passive role of bystander into the active role of resister. I was embarrassed by this, knowing that at a different time or place or state of mind, I would have been one of the many people to drive on by. So many of us are distracted, busy waiting for joy and contentment in our own lives that we forget about the sacredness of everyone else’s, like Mary.Without trying, Mary sobered me, helped me see my shortcomings as an ally to those in need. I did something humane that night to be sure, but in return, I was confronted with the limits of my compassion. How conditional is my consciousness? How do all my good intentions perform in the face of tribulation? Do I engage in justice as much as I speak about it? Allyship is about action and impact because intention alone is both partial and vain. Well-intentioned people sometimes cause the greatest harm.I do wish I could see Mary again, to return her “God bless you” and tell her about all the ways her resilience inspired me. That though I wish we met under different circumstances and though these meditations do not rectify what she went through, the warmth of her heart and the honesty of her voice reminded me of the power of human connection. That she presented something raw and real of herself to a stranger in a world that had (at least recently) been nothing but cruel to her.I do not define Mary by her pain but see her instead for all she aspired to be for herself and her family. She remains my reminder of the depths that exist in us all, the trials that inevitably shake us, and the possibilities that keep us moving."

How We Recreated the Dixie Wildfire’s Plume from Radar and Satellite Data,The NYT Open Team,Oct 29,https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-recreated-the-dixie-wildfires-plume-from-radar-and-satellite-data-d6e829a727cd?source=home---------78------------------0----------,"By Nick BartzokasIn mid-July, 2021, the Dixie fire ignited in California. Days later, it began to exhibit an increasingly common and concerning behavior. It created its own weather, producing storm clouds, winds, and lightning. In October of that year, The New York Times published a visual recreation of the fire’s activity.This coverage took a team of diverse talents. This article highlights the technical work, specifically that of Evan Grothjan, Daniel Mangosing, Scott Reinhard and myself. To learn more about the inspiration and reporting that went into this piece, check out this Times Insider article for some perspective from our teammates Noah Pisner, Nadja Popovich, and Karthik Patanjali.Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist who studies wildfires, advised us on this project. He popularized a technique for creating 3D animations of wildfire plumes from radar data. We decided to adapt that technique for an interactive web article and an AR story on Instagram. Our newsroom’s graphics editors in collaboration with software engineers in R&D assembled radar, satellite, and other weather data into an animated, 3D illustration giving readers an up-close look at the phenomenon of fire-driven weather. Here’s a flythrough of the final result.Let’s first focus on the ground level datasets we used: terrain color and height, the position and timing of lightning strikes, and the coverage of the fire itself. The scientific software community provides a wealth of open source tools we can use to work with these types of data.For the California terrain that sits below our smoke plume, we gathered high resolution (10 meter) imagery from the Sentinel 2 satellite’s L1C product using the sentinelhub-py library which lets you specify a range of dates to composite together into a cloudless image of the Earth’s surface. To add a height dimension, we retrieved a grayscale digital elevation model (DEM) from 3DEP using the py3dep library, as this example demonstrates.We received lightning strike data from Vaisala, a company that monitors global weather and environmental conditions. Using geopandas, we generated an image sequence indicating the locations where lightning struck the ground as small dots. Evan Grothjan aligned these reference images to the terrain in his scene, designed realistic lightning bolts, and positioned them above each of the dots.Scott Reinhard worked on one of the most crucial components, a visual representation of the fire spreading over the land. He sourced burn area and intensity data from GOES and VIIRS, and perimeter data from CalFIRE. Using gdal and other tools, he created an animation of the fire’s intensity and behavior on the ground.After laying the groundwork for the plume visualization, Scott developed the visual language and iconography used to call attention to the plume’s behaviors, and mapped the extent of the fire in a 2D graphic later in the article.Having constructed the ground-level part of our scene, we now turn our attention to visualizing the fire’s plume in 3D. Data for this visualization came from three NEXRAD radar stations in California and Nevada. Each recorded the Dixie fire’s activity roughly every 10 minutes. We previewed and selected datasets using NOAA’s Weather and Climate Toolkit (WCT).Radar stations emit pulses of radio waves and observe what gets reflected back. Denser stuff in the air, like water droplets in clouds and large ash particles in smoke plumes, reflect the radar pulse more powerfully. The power of the returning signal, called “reflectivity”, approximates the density of airborne matter. The time it takes for the reflection to return indicates the distance of that substance. The radar makes many such observations, sweeping 360 degrees for several vertical angles.As we began to assemble data for this project, we didn’t know what area and what times to visualize. And since the fire was ongoing, we needed quick access to up-to-date data in 3D. To solve these problems, we created an automated pipeline allowing us to specify a date range and map region and quickly preview what the plume looked like then and there. As the project evolved, we added steps to process and refine the data, focusing on features that were central to the story. Fast transformations from data to visuals enabled us to pivot quickly when new examples of relevant behavior happened in real time. Here’s how we built that pipeline.NOAA hosts its NEXRAD data online where we retrieved it using the Siphon library. We then used Py-ART, a powerful python tool for working with radar observations, to merge the datasets of multiple radar stations, conform them to a regular cartesian grid, and apply spatial interpolation with algorithms tailored to the nuances of radar data. Already, we were able to quickly visualize 3D atmospheric data from any time and space observed by NEXRAD.To target a time range for our story, we periodically rendered a low resolution timelapse of the entire dataset. This way we could quickly scan hundreds of hours of data and hone in on particularly active days. As we looked closer at the most eventful time periods, we found that all of the key behaviors of interest to the story occurred on July 19 between 11:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m, Pacific Daylight Time.With the data selected and normalized, our next task was to export files for our graphics artists to animate. NEXRAD data is stored as NetCDF files. This format encodes multi-dimensional datasets flexibly and is commonly used across many scientific disciplines. However, we needed this data in a format compatible with CG software. For that we used OpenVDB. It is widely compatible and has its own python library. We exported our radar data as a time-series of OpenVDB volumes, and brought them into Houdini.Airborne material may reflect radar beams, but that doesn’t guarantee it will be visible to the naked eye. Reflectivity isn’t the same as visible opacity. So we needed to find an appropriate reflectivity threshold that would define the edges of Dixie’s plume. Thankfully, Alert Wildfire recorded time lapse footage of Dixie. By comparing this footage with our renders side-by-side, we ensured that we were representing the visible plume as faithfully as possible.From time to time we needed to render the data in a new way so that a characteristic could be observed visually. For example, the maximum height of the fire plume was an important point discussed in the story. We acquired the height observed in the field from our interviews with experts and wanted to find that moment in our data. Since there is noise in radar data, a simple max of the sample values would not suffice as it might pick up one of the noisy pops. Instead, we rendered an orthographic visual test to spot the plume’s highest moment.Since our data had passed through a number of processing steps, when it arrived in Houdini, we wanted to check the integrity of the entire dataset, even the interior which was never shown in the article’s graphics. We rendered nested isosurfaces to check that the plume’s core remained intact and matched the expectations of our collaborating scientists.Our layers of data were all combined in Houdini for further production and needed to be aligned exactly. GIS software understands geospatial data and projections, but most CG apps and formats do not. To ensure accurate alignment, all outputs from python conformed to a common projection and bounding box. That meant that aligning layers in Houdini was as easy as snapping their edges. We rendered top-down orthographic tests to confirm that all our data layers lined up properly.At this point, our plume visualization was detailed enough to demonstrate the large-scale behaviors central to the article but they lacked surface detail, small-scale undulations without which the plume appeared deceptively small and calm.Referencing time lapse footage, Daniel Mangosing used Houdini’s Cloud Noise and Volume Wrangle nodes to churn the surface and give our illustration an appropriate sense of scale and activity. This work was done carefully, however, as we did not want to affect any of the large-scale behaviors on which we relied for the story. So while he developed the look of these noise patterns, he tested them on smooth blimp-like shapes, making sure the new undulations remained minor, in a shallow layer on the surface.As mentioned earlier, NEXRAD radar stations record observations roughly every 10 minutes. But a fire plume changes much faster than that. In order to create a smooth animation through time, we needed to improve our temporal resolution. For this step Daniel used Houdini’s Retime node which can interpolate in-between frames for volumes.Finally, Evan Grothjan and Scott Reinhard developed the look of our final renders. Our goal was to signal to the reader that this is a representation of the event, but not the event itself. Removing the sky was one simple but effective way to do this. Using Cinema 4D and the Redshift renderer, Evan tweaked the plume’s color and material properties, scene lighting, camera work and rendering. Evan and Scott explored a number of visual effects in the scene, ultimately selecting a design that balanced our visual priorities: clarity where our visuals supported the story, and an aesthetic that evoked scientific illustration.Here again is the full animation from the article.In addition to our coverage on the web and in our app, we published an augmented reality experience on Instagram using the Spark AR platform. This presented a unique challenge. For our web article, we rendered a video through which a reader progresses by scrolling. In AR, the user is free to look at the plume from any angle, so we couldn’t pre-render the content. It had to be rendered in real-time on the mobile device. That would prove difficult since Spark effects are limited to 4 MB, and the platform doesn’t support rendering volumes yet. Luckily these are problems that graphics programmers have had to solve before. In fact we had already used a time-tested technique, rendering a volume as slices, in our work visualizing volumetric data for the article Why Opening Windows Is a Key to Reopening Schools and its accompanying augmented reality experience.To get Houdini VDBs into AR, we used a process analogous to medical CT scanning. We captured many cross sections of the plume and exported those slices as sprite sheets using the Volume Texture Export node. We also generated geometry on which to render that imagery, a stack of planes. With enough slices tightly packed together, the gaps aren’t noticeable. The layers combine together to create what looks like a solid volume.CG software renders volumes in a rich environment of lighting and reflections. Converting volumes to a stack of cards rules out the option of natural lighting. Luckily, Houdini provides a way to bake the effects of lighting into the color of a volume, effectively rendering lighting effects before the export, using the Bake Volume node. Using this node, we baked in sunlight, shadows, and a red glow from the underlying fire.With our fire plume rendered in augmented reality as a stack of cards, some creative options opened up to us. We could reveal the plume from top to bottom in an animation sequence and tint a subset of slices to draw attention to which layers of atmosphere they occupied. These ended up being useful devices for storytelling in AR.This project is one of many efforts to visualize 3D data sets. Some of the techniques developed in our coverage of the Dixie fire helped us tell the story of The Chain of Failures That Left 17 Dead in a Bronx Apartment Fire. Our work visualizing data continues in the hope that insights drawn from these graphics will help our readers and the world make better, more informed decisions in the future.Nick Bartzokas is an R&D Engineer at The New York Times.

The Next Wave: Predicting the future of coffee in New York City,Topos,"Sep 7, 2017",https://medium.com/topos-ai/the-next-wave-predicting-the-future-of-coffee-in-new-york-city-23a0c5d62000?source=home---------68------------------0----------,"The geography of economic activity is a critical force that shapes cities around the world. From infrastructure to housing, urban transformation is often influenced by the location of specific businesses. Coffee shops in New York City are no exception.Using data from dozens of different sources and techniques from a wide range of technologies and disciplines including game theory, machine learning, natural language processing, statistics, and urbanism, we formulated a model that predicts optimal coffee shop locations in New York City. Our findings reveal that the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn all show more economic promise than Manhattan, and resonate with recent population and job growth outside of Manhattan. In this article, we describe the iterative development of our predictive models and reveal specific forecasts of what the future of coffee in New York City might look like.New York City revolves around coffee. Considering there are 3,389 coffee shops in NYC, it is no wonder the city never sleeps. Dating back to the mid-1600s, while other colonies preferred drinking tea, New Yorkers were primarily drinking coffee. In the early-1800s, New York was one of the largest coffee roasting centers in the United States. More recently, mobile startup MassiveHealth found that New Yorkers drink 6.7 times the amount of coffee consumed by the average denizen of any other US city. If you’re a New Yorker, you’re probably drinking a cup right now.Coffee has been so central to New York City that one of its serving vessels — the classic ‘Anthora’ cup designed by Leslie Buck in 1963 — has become an icon of the city. Despite this enshrined position, coffee culture in NYC is anything but static; while it is still possible to buy coffee in an Anthora from a street cart or bodega, it is by no means the dominant paradigm. Like elsewhere in the US, New York’s coffee scene has ridden various “coffee waves”. Today’s NYC coffee landscape is hugely varied. And while we don’t take a stand on contentious topics like the emergence of the 4th wave, taking into account the diversity of the NYC coffee scene is core to our modeling efforts.The map below displays all 3,389 coffee shops in NYC (excluding restaurants, supermarkets, and other stores that might also sell coffee). Each point on the map represents a location-based business decision, and it is immediately clear that some areas in NYC are more popular than others (with Midtown and Lower Manhattan leading the way).To understand why coffee shops establish themselves where they do, we wondered: What makes one neighborhood more appealing than another? Why do coffee shops tend to cluster in the same areas? Are existing coffee shop locations optimal for business?To answer these questions, we constructed a model that simulates the coffee shop landscape in NYC. Using ideas from Game Theory as a foundation, our process can be divided into:As consumers, deciding where to buy coffee is relatively easy. For the most part, our decisions come down to a trade off between preference, affordability, and convenience: how far will you travel and how much will you pay to get coffee from your favorite coffee shop?As coffee shop owners, deciding where to locate is more complex. Should you set up shop near Bryant Park (Manhattan) despite an oversaturated competitive landscape? Should you locate in a less competitive area like Tottenville (Staten Island) despite lower customer density? Should high-end coffee shops go to Gramercy (Manhattan) since apartment rents are higher than other parts of the city?In order to postulate a general set of factors for predicting coffee shop locations, we started with the well-known “Hotelling Location Model” (1929) and its Principle of Minimum Differentiation. The Hotelling Model springs from the idea that vendors choose locations based on proximity to customers. Using this strategy, competitors tend to locate close to the same place — in the middle of all potential customers. This resonates with the map above: NYC coffee shops overwhelmingly cluster in Midtown and Lower Manhattan, the two densest parts of the city.While Hotelling’s theory is useful for understanding how distance to customers and competition affect business locations, there are limitations. Hotelling assumed that all vendors have identical offerings, a far cry from NYC coffee in 2017. Some revisions of Hotelling’s theory even claim that competitors with different offerings tend to pick locations as far away from each other as possible in order to create monopoly power. Thus, we will also be considering the factors that differentiate coffee shops — quality, price level, and coffee shop culture.Finally, since we’re modeling real world locations (with zoning restrictions and surrounding neighborhoods) we include available commercial locations, neighborhood culture, and neighborhood wealth in our models.We began developing our simulation with a basic set of equations that stuck close to Hotelling’s original distance-based formulation. For each equation, we have variable weights (Wu1, Wu2, etc) that we algorithmically tune, refining our models iteratively to produce more realistic results.Utility of coffee shop C. We define our utility function to be the tradeoff between the quality of coffee shop C and distance to coffee shop C:where the Quality of C is determined by aggregating user reviews of C from a variety of sources)Probability of a customer going to coffee chop C. We define the probability of a customer choosing coffee shop C to be the Utility of C divided by the Sum of the Utility of all other coffee shops in the area of C:Expected number of customers for coffee shop C in neighborhood N. We can estimate the number of customers a coffee shop C would have if it were to locate in a given neighborhood N by taking the sum, across all neighborhoods n of the product of the Probability of Choosing C in n times the population of n. Or more succinctly put:With these equations in hand, we ran through the 3,389 coffee shops in New York City and sequentially located each one in an optimal neighborhood by allowing coffee shops to relocate until reaching a near Nash equilibrium. This provided our first results.Our first simulated results had little to do with the current coffee shop mapping of NYC, though it did bear a striking resemblance to mappings of residential populations across the city. This failing makes sense in light of one of coffee’s core features: it is a daytime drink. Thus the first refinement we made to the model was to use the daytime (rather than residential) population of neighborhoods in our model.Incorporating daytime population into our model produced an intense concentration of coffee shops in lower and midtown Manhattan, and resulted in a map that came closer to reality. However certain areas (Fifth Avenue, Wall Street) were clearly oversaturated, with coffee shops occupying an impossible number of adjacent locations.We addressed this problem by incorporating one of the key inputs discussed above: coffee shops should only be allowed to locate in commercially zoned spaces.Incorporating commercial zoning into our model produced a map that again came closer to the current NYC coffee landscape. The oversaturation of Central Park South and Wall Street was ameliorated, and placement of coffee shops outside of Manhattan started to articulate main thoroughfares, capturing neighborhood life in the outer boroughs.While we were happy with the placements in aggregate, we hadn’t yet taken into account perhaps the single most important economic factor: price.We incorporated price into our model by revising our Utility function, setting:Adding price as an input to the model necessitated a refinement of our success metric — rather than number of customers, total revenue now defined success.We then allowed coffee shops to set their own price, resulting in a trade off: As coffee shops set their price higher, they make more money per customer, but risk having fewer customers.Furthermore, to account for the wide variations in NYC pricing (of meals, rentals, houses, etc) we included a composite Neighborhood Economy Index as an input; therefore the pricier a neighborhood is in general, the less the price of coffee matters in our model.While the overall location selection closely resembled reality (as it did in our previous model), the geographic price distribution was far off. In particular, simulated coffee prices in Manhattan were significantly lower than they should be, due to the following set of implications:High density of coffee shops in Manhattan → High level of competition in Manhattan → Lower prices in ManhattanAs it turned out, this failure was instructive, resonating with a truth familiar to anyone who has bought a pour-over coffee in the East Village in 2017 — In Manhattan, coffee shops do not compete on price, they compete on culture.La Colombe and Dunkin’ Donuts do not compete solely on price because they present radically divergent cultures (and products) to consumers. Individual coffee shops target different segments of the population — A third wave coffee shop might do well in Bushwick, but will likely avoid Times Square. Dunkin’ Donuts may find more success in Times Square and want to stay away from the L train, where it has been less than welcomed.To account for these differences, we divided coffee into three (sure to be contentious) groupings: Mainstream (Blue in maps; Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, 7-Eleven…), Third Wave (Pink in maps; Stumptown, La Colombe, Blue Bottle…) and Local (Green in maps; NYC only).Leveraging Topos’s suite of features and indices (which capture a ‘Psychographic’ portrait of every neighborhood) we were able to compute the cultural fit of each coffee shop C for every NYC neighborhood N. We then further revised our Utility function to take into account cultural fit:As with other simulations, we allowed each coffee shop to relocate until reaching a near Nash equilibrium across all factors. This equilibrium condition ensured that neighborhoods don’t become oversaturated with a particular category of coffee shop, even if that category is the optimal cultural fit.As can be seen above, the simulated results came close to the reality of coffee culture in NYC in 2017. Midtown is filled with Mainstream coffee shops. Third Wave coffee shops cluster in Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and eastern Queens, but rarely in the Bronx and never in Staten Island. Local coffee shops are not confined to any one area since they all tend to be different. While we undoubtedly could have continued to refine our model to account for ever more detail (Pour over? Kyoto-style cold brew towers? Next-gen coffee sodas?) at this point we felt the model had achieved a level of reality where we were curious what predictions it would make about the future of coffee in NYC.Maintaining the existing ratio of Mainstream : Local : Third Wave coffee shops, we used our model to simulate the optimal location of the next 200 coffee shops to open in NYC.At a high level, the most surprising insight was the low number of predicted coffee shops in Manhattan.In contrast, the Bronx presented a wealth of opportunities, claiming the largest share (31%) of the 200 simulated points. This resonates with the Bronx’s recent surge in population and jobs in the private sector.For more cultural specificity, we decided to plot the next 10 predicted locations for a few coffee categories and franchises.With the exception of Battery Park, Dunkin’ Donuts finds more success moving far from Manhattan, with only a single Manhattan location vs 4 in the Bronx and 4 in Queens.Bronx: 4; Queens:4; Manhattan: 1; Brooklyn: 1In contrast to Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks finds significant opportunity in Manhattan, where its higher prices are less of a factor. Nonetheless, over half of Starbucks projected locations are in the outer boroughs.Manhattan: 5; Queens: 3; Bronx: 1; Brooklyn: 1While Manhattan and Brooklyn still present the most opportunity for third wave coffee shops (as might be expected), it is interesting to note some specific location trends within each borough: upwards in Manhattan, and outwards in Brooklyn. Rather than solely clustering in Lower Manhattan and commuter Brooklyn, we find Manhattan locations moving up towards Harlem and Brooklyn locations moving away from commuter neighborhoods, making it as far as Ridgewood in Queens (which, to be fair, may be the most Brooklyn of Queens neighborhoods)Manhattan: 5; Brooklyn: 4; Queens: 1Coffee shops are undoubtedly a small piece of the much larger puzzle that is contemporary urban living; yet their importance should not be underestimated. From their influence on the enlightenment to their ever-evolving status as a “third place”, coffee shops — and the culture they participate in, create, and project — have played a vital, often controversial role in shaping urban experience. Thus understanding coffee shops in a variety of ways — from analyzing the language used to discuss particular franchises with NLP to simulating future coffee landscapes — constitutes a small but vital aspect of the way we, at Topos, are changing the understanding of cities through the twin lenses of big data and artificial intelligence.This post is part of an ongoing series capturing different insights we generate while developing our platform.

A Clash of Two Systems,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Apr 19,https://medium.com/incerto/a-clash-of-two-systems-47009e9715e2?source=home---------108------------------0----------,"( This is a copyright compatible version of my side of a conversation with Laetitia Strauch-Bonart published in the French periodical l’Express.)This conflict shows a harmful confusion, among the Russians and their supporters, between the state as a nation in the ethnic sense and the state as an administrative entity.A state that wants to base its legitimacy on cultural unity must be small; it is otherwise doomed to meet the hostility of others. A Francophone Swiss citizen, although culturally linked to his or her language, does not aspire to belong to France, and France does not try to invade French-speaking Switzerland under this pretext. Further, national identities can change quickly: Francophone Belgians have a different identity from French people. France itself went through an operation of internal colonialism to destroy Provençal, Languedoc, Picard, Savoyard, Breton, and other cultures and eradicate their languages under a centralized identity. Nationality is never defined and never fixed; administration is.Cultural unity can make sense, but only in the form of something reduced such as a city-state –I would even go so far as to say that a state only works well in this way. In this case, nationalism is defensive — Catalan, Basque or Christian Lebanese — but in the case of a large state like Russia, nationalism becomes offensive. Notice that under the Pax Romana or the Pax Ottomana, there were no large states, but city-states gathered in an empire whose role was distant. But there is loose empire and rigid nation-state like empire, the latter being represented by Russia .There are now two imperial models: either a heavy model, like that of Russia, or a coordination of states on the model of NATO. We will see which one will emerge victorious from the current conflict. This war not only pits Ukraine and Russia against it, it is a confrontation between two systems, one modern, decentralized and multicephalous, the other archaic, centralized and autocephalous. Ukraine wants to belong to the liberal system: while being Slavic-speaking, like Poland, it wants to be part of the West.What we call “the West” is not a spiritual entity, but an administrative system first and last. Is is not an ethno-geographical ensemble, but a legal and institutional system: it includes Japan, S. Korea, and Taiwan. It mixes the thalassocratic Phoenician world of network-based trade and that of Adam Smith, based on individual rights and freedom to transact, under the constraint of social progress. In the United States, the difference between Democrats and Republicans is minor when seen from a different century. Both sides wants social progress, but at different rates of growth.On the other hand, nationalism requires the All-Mighty Centralized –worse, Hegelian — State, and one that curates cultural life to weed out individual variations.Nationalism is often linked to a spiritual dimension — represented in the Patriarch of Moscow via the Russian-Slavo-Orthodox model –which horriifies me as an Orthodox myself. Moreover, this alleged proximity between Ukraine and Russia is questionable: Crimea has been Russian since Catherine II, and Stalin has russified it by displacing the Tatars. It is easy to say that Ukraine is the soul of Russia because it comes from the Rus’ of Kiev, but it can just as well be said that it is the Golden Horde of the sons of Genghis Khan.And even if, spiritually, Ukraine were part of Russia, it would not mean that Ukrainians would not have the right to join the Western system. They could be emotionally Slavic but administratively organized in a Western system and militarily protected through an alliance between Westerners — which even includes, I remind you, Turkey. Putin cannot understand this, nor some specialists in international relations who are sometimes called “realists” — I am thinking, for example, of John Mearsheimer.These sloppy thinkers such as Mearsheimer and similar handwavers conflate states with individual interests; they believe that there is only a balance of power between powers — for Mearsheimer, Putin is only reacting to undue progress by the West on its ground. But the reality is quite different: what Ukrainians want is to be part of what I would call an international “benign” order, which works well because it is self-correcting, and where the balance of power can exist but remain harmless. Putin and the “realists” are the wrong century, they do not think in terms of systems or in terms of individuals. They suffer from what I call the “Westphalia Syndrome” — the reification of states as natural and fixed Platonic entities.Solzhenitsyn clearly saw the diabolical aspect of communist society, but believed that Western society was just as harmful. But being naturally multicentric, the West aims to be like Switzerland — it’s bottom-top oriented in spite of occasional concentration. Furthermore, the “West” is evolving; it does not have fixed centers of authority. Certainly, there are disproportionate influences in the West, as today’s Google and yesterday’s General Motors, but Google or General Motors are not the center of it — these multinationals do not even control themselves.Multinationals tend to go bust — in fact they are more likely to fold than your family run business.This model tends to “antifragility” — a concept present in my books that refers to a property of systems that strengthen when exposed to stressors, shocks or volatility. Russia cannot be what I call “antifragile”.A stable system requires a decentralized and multicephalous organization, which makes it possible to correct errors and avoid the deleterious effects of certain risks by confining them to the local level. After the 1918 war, the French destroyed Syria by centralizing it. Conversely, when the new Germany was formed, the French insisted that it be federal under the illusion that it would weaken it. Deprived of a center of gravity, Germany no longer thought of waging war, but of making… money. Butter, it turns out, works better than guns. Germany became an economic power thanks to federalism — and it appears to be natural as it spent its history in fragmented states before the Prussian takeover. For Russia, such a decentralized organization would be impossible: if let go of ballast, it would immediately find itself facing the secession of 20 small states — Chechnya, Ingushetia, Bashkiria… It therefore tightens the screw in the other direction.The interest of the Western world is that it is a multicephalous model, made of contracts that allows regional autonomy under global coordination; Russia is an autocephalous system, which thinks only in a balance of power. Look at the West: is there a center? No. If there were one, moreover, he would be in Kiev today. And if you want to destroy the West, how many bombs do you need? If you destroy Washington, London and Paris will remain. But if you destroy the palace where Putin is, it’s something else.The stability of a decentralized system is much better than that of a centralized system. As such, I am pleasantly surprised by the reaction of the Western world, which was done so, organically. I thought the West could not face Putin, because a fight between an autocrat and employees seemed lost to me in advance, but it seems that the aggregation of our actions is beginning to bear fruit.Subsidiarity was not respected, hence the departure of the United Kingdom. But the appropriate model is that of NATO, which exists in the area where organized joint action is necessary — military reaction — while letting countries do what they want under constraint not to attack each other. And I am grateful to the European Union for having succeeded in starting the concept of nation to think more in terms of regional coordination.Only if it fragments into separate states. Some Russian groups have always been irredentist, the Cossacks, the Kulaks (localist farmers), and the Siberians. There are also many minorities. More broadly, because of this Westphalia complex, it is forgotten that the Russians do not necessarily have the same interests as Russia. National interests are abstract things, and people end up believing in them even when they conflict with those of those populations they encompass.The Patriarch of Moscow was also Patriarch of Ukraine. But in the Orthodox world, whenever an ethnic or language division occurs, a “minor patriarch” is appointed in the country that has become independent — this is the case in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania. This is why the Patriarch of Constantinople, the most important, assented to the request that the Metropolitan of Kiev becomes a minor patriarch in 2019. Because of this separation, the Russian Orthodox Church felt amputated. The Patriarch of Moscow, Cyril, supports Putin. The Patriarch of Antioch, close to Assad, does the same.This also confirms, if it were still needed, the absurdity of Samuel Huntington’s ideas in The Clash of Civilizations. Not only is his book full of pseudo-mathematical reasoning (causing Serge Lang to blackball him at the Academy of Sciences), but, like other “realists”, his obstinacy to think in geopolitical and identity centers leads him to conclude that Ukraine belongs to the Russian domain. But one can be Orthodox in New York!It takes a while for a collective and distributed system to react. It takes a lot of sheep to fight a wolf, and in 2014 we were too few sheep.People want to be able to trade together in Adam Smith’s world. This false debate reminds me of the opposition between Napoleon and the English.All the English initially wanted was for their products to arrive safely. Napoleon’s views did not interest them. While Napoleon thought in terms of the glory of France, they thought of the wallet of the English shop owner. But the English grocer won and, with the Phoenician trader, it was he who made the modern world — the Anglo-Phoenician world of mercantile cosmopolitanism. This is what means, for example, that today Germans are more interested in exporting cars than in Germany’s geographic expansion.Moreover, it amuses me to hear some people talk about “American cultural imperialism”. Do you think that in the morning, when they wake up, Americans think about exporting their music and food? It’s simply that on the other side of the planet, young people prefer to eat hamburgers.The modern liberal system makes mistakes, yes. But when I criticize it, I don’t aim at destroy it, but at improving it. And it is a good system because it is self-correcting. I criticize naive Western interventions because I think about their consequences: I was against the war in Iraq, and experience justified my fears; I am against intervention in Syria, because if we get rid of Assad, we do not know what will replace him; I have nothing against Brexit, because if the British think they can manage to be part of our system without depending on the Brussels bureaucratic machinery, it is their right.The problem posed by a benign system like ours is its transparency, which causes perceptional distortions: Tocqueville understood that equality seems all the stronger when it is reduced; similarly, a system seems all the more dysfunctional when it is transparent. Hence my attacks on someone like Edward Snowden and his acolytes, who exploit this paradox to attack the West for the benefit of Russian plotters.I have trouble with many people, often naive libertarians, who think I’m like them because they like my books. But some of these want to destroy our system rather than improve it: many are full of resentment.This is the case of Snowden and his followers. He is an impostor. If I told you about an organization in Ryad that defends women in France against male oppression, you would laugh at me. Well, Snowden claims to defend the Americans against Google’s tyranny while operating from … Moscow!On Twitter, I ended up noticing that in this naive libertarian or rather, pseudo-libertarian, ecosystem, which includes bitcoin enthusiasts, people who, like Snowden, see Covid-19 as a pretext for some dark entity to exert control over the population. This even includes anti-vaccine activists. We are at the very heart of disinformation: the goal of the Russian Disinformation Program here is to create mistrust between citizens and authorities, and to exploit everything that can bring dissension. Disinformation proceeds according to Stalin’s assumed quote: “The death of a man is a tragedy. The death of a million men is a statistic.” These activists, for example, magnify tiny dysfunctions of the Covid-19 vaccines.I began to spot Twitter accounts called “Linda”, pro-Trump who, in protesting against inflation, used the sign of the ruble instead of the dollar. When the same people support both Canadian truck drivers and Vladimir Putin, there is a problem. In a way, I came to defend Ukraine because the same fools who attacked me on Covid also defended Putin.It is still disturbing that libertarians come to defend an autocrat!Libertarians are controlled by Russia because in general, they are naive people who only have first-order thoughts — they do not know how to consider the consequences of certain actions. This is what distinguishes them from classic liberals.We didn’t wait for this war to realize that Pinker was wrong about the decline of violence. There is no such a thing as Long Peace, largely because the past was not as violent as Pinker claims. My colleagues and I refuted Pinker’s calculations in our research. His errors come in particular from the fact that some data he uses overestimate the number of deaths in past conflicts. Pinker wants to play the guardian of modern liberal thought, but it is the American BHL: he knows nothing about his subject.Moreover, even if this conflict ends well, it will have shown that it is enough for a state to have nuclear weapons to cause a disaster. However, in today’s world, it is not acceptable for a leader to conquer another territory simply because he owns the atomic bomb. This principle must be destroyed.Which brings us to the next risk, China. Certainly, it has not escaped the modern world as much as Russia, and it is closely linked commercially to the West. But it also has imperial tendencies. The best thing would therefore be for it too to decentralize to escape the yoke of Beijing. Taiwan and Honk Kong outperform China, so consider more of those!If you give Putin even one finger, he will have won the war. Russia’s leadership must therefore be humiliated, and the only way is for it to retreat. We need a repetition of the 1905 Russo-Japanese war. In this case, Putin will be overthrown from the inside, because, historically, people who accept autocracies do not like the weak. A weak Putin is no longer Putin — just as a nice, tactful, and thoughtful Trump would no longer be Trump. For this to continue, it takes a lot of suckers to keep feeding the narrative — and if the suckers begin to doubt the story, it will be the beginning of the end.BACKGROUND"

How to Create Mattering at Work,"Zach Mercurio, PhD",Nov 16,https://zachmercurio.medium.com/how-to-create-mattering-at-work-bef6b78fbe40?source=home---------15------------------0----------,"Last month, the U.S. Surgeon General named “mattering at work” a top priority for improving mental health. The announcement reaffirms what we’ve known for many years: Mattering and well-being are inseparable, especially where humans spend 35% of their waking lives.The official call to prioritize mattering at work is the culmination of several conspiring forces reshaping what work means to and in our lives.Survey research shows that the pandemic prompted people to reflect more on the quality of their jobs and their lives. Data from the past two years indicate that people left their jobs not for more pay, benefits, or flexibility but largely because of disrespectful cultures, non-inclusive climates, and uncaring leaders.People deemed “essential” workers are now asking, “Do I feel essential?” We’re experiencing compounding health and job insecurity. The unemployed are returning to work, with studies showing that feelings of worthlessness constitute a significant risk factor for those transitioning from joblessness. Feelings of being forgotten and loneliness are at an all-time high amidst rising calls for social justice and inclusion.Upheaval events amplify people’s search for meaning, and we’re seeing a grasp for significance and demand for dignity in work. Creating mattering is a necessary answer.Mattering is the belief that we’re significant to the world around us. Psychologists and sociologists find that mattering arises from two primary experiences: 1. Feeling valued by those around us, and 2. Adding value to those around us.Mattering isn’t the same as self-esteem. Self-esteem is confidence in our worth and abilities. Self-esteem is one internal outcome of experiencing mattering to others. Mattering isn’t interchangeable with “belonging” either. When we feel like we belong, we feel welcomed, accepted, and approved by a group. When we feel like we matter, we feel significant to members of that group — we feel seen, important, and needed through how others treat us. A sense of belonging increases the chance we experience mattering and vice versa.When people do feel valued and know how they add value in life and work, decades of studies show they’re less likely to experience unhealthy stress, anxiety, and severe depression and much more likely to experience increased self-esteem, motivation, and overall well-being.In contrast, the perpetual belief that one doesn’t, can’t, and won’t matter is a hallmark of low self-esteem, disengagement in life and work, withdrawal, and clinical depression. One study of 1,026 Tennessee residents found that feeling insignificant predicted objective stress indicators like higher cortisol levels and blood pressure.The need to create mattering at work is not a new well-being trend or “touchy-feely” idea. Creating mattering is about as “touchy-feely” as feeding someone who’s hungry. When we create mattering for others, we meet a basic human need and fulfill a primal survival instinct.Mattering comes first. When we’re born, our survival depends on whether we matter to others. As a newborn, one of your first reflexes was to lift your head and scan the room to search for someone to care for you. You then reached out to grasp that caretaker. We need the care of others, and our primal need for attachment doesn’t go away as we move into and through adulthood.The survival instinct for attachment grows into the social need to be noticed and included by others. Psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary label the desire for caring interpersonal relationships a “fundamental human motivation.”New York University philosopher and Humanities Medal recipient Rebecca Newberger Goldstein goes further and deems mattering a core instinct that drives all human behavior. “Our mattering instinct is inseparable from pursuing a coherent human life,” she said in a recent interview.That’s why, when someone doesn’t believe they matter at work, it’s easy for nothing to matter. People won’t share their voice if they don’t believe their voice is significant. People won’t use their strengths if they don’t believe they have strengths. People won’t contribute if they don’t believe they have something to contribute. People won’t care until they feel cared for.Mattering comes first and filling people’s need for significance must be a core practice for redeeming work and revitalizing our organizations and society.There are three primary drivers of mattering at work: 1. Feeling Noticed, 2. Feeling Affirmed, and 3. Feeling Needed.Noticing others is the deliberate act of seeing someone’s uniqueness, paying attention to the ebbs and flows of their lives, and taking action to show them you see them.Noticing someone isn’t the same as “knowing” someone. You can know your best friend but not notice that they’re struggling. You can know a team member but not notice that their parent is in the hospital or that they’ve been struggling with a project.Feeling seen is necessary for mattering, yet it’s often overlooked. Global surveys find close to 43% of employees feel “invisible.” When it comes to taking an interest in others, it seems common sense isn’t common practice.Here are several practices and skills to ensure people feel noticed:Real affirmation is showing people how their unique strengths make a unique impact. In workplaces, meaningful gratitude and affirmation are infrequent, and most workers report feeling perpetually underappreciated and undervalued.Affirmation is more than an awards ceremony, simple acknowledgment, or a pay raise. Real affirmation is creating an environment that regularly provides people the evidence of their significance.Here are some essential practices to affirm others:Human beings are at their best when they’re needed. In our research, when we ask people to describe the moments of mattering in their lives, we often hear people talk about becoming a caretaker, a parent, or being called on to assume responsibility for someone else. It’s no different in work; when people feel irreplaceable, they act irreplaceable. They show up. They commit.On the flip side, when people feel replaceable, they act replaceable. They won’t show up. They won’t commit. Ensuring people feel indispensable and needed is key to creating mattering.Here’s how to show people how they’re needed:Try it right now. Think about the people you need. Take a moment today to tell them, “if it wasn’t for you…” and watch what happens.You’ll see and experience what the research indicates: Few things are more powerful than when a human being realizes they matter.Zach Mercurio, Ph.D., is a purposeful leadership, mattering, meaningful work, and positive organizations researcher, consultant, and author of “The Invisible Leader: Transform Your Life, Work, and Organization with the Power of Authentic Purpose.”"

Why Practicing Gratitude is Good For Your Health,Catherine A. Sanderson,Nov 21,https://medium.com/@casanderson/why-practicing-gratitude-is-good-for-your-health-32855b5aeaa7?source=home---------21------------------0----------,"For as long as I can remember, my mom’s family has spent Thanksgiving together. For years we gathered — uncles, aunts, cousins — at my grandmother’s small ranch home in Southern Georgia — with some of us supplementing the traditional dinner with a late night trip to Waffle House.Then in 2004, our family suffered two tremendous losses. First, my mother died in July — only 4 months after being diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer. Then, my grandmother died in November, following a short illness likely brought on by the death of her only daughter.That year we gathered at a funeral, not over turkey. And I wondered whether our tradition would continue, given the absence of the two women who had — like in most families — organized our family gatherings for decades.But my uncle — now the oldest living child — rose to the occasion. He set up a schedule in which each family would alternate hosting, with my brother and I stepping in for our mom. We’ve now continued that plan for the last 18 years (with a one year interruption in 2020 due to covid).Much will be written this week about the stress of Thanksgiving, from the difficulties of traffic jams and delayed flights to the challenges of cooking a turkey and pleasing picky eaters. But this week is a great time for us all to instead focus on what we’re grateful for in our lives — and empirical research reveals that doing so is good for our happiness and our health.Researchers in one simple study randomly assigned people to one of three groups:Before the study started, all participants had kept daily journals recording their moods, physical health, and general attitudes. The researchers could then compare how people in these different groups changed over time.Can you predict the findings? People who focused on what they were grateful for felt 25 percent happier — they were more optimistic about the future and they felt better about their lives. People in this group also reporting exercising more and had fewer symptoms of illness.Although this study was conducted with relatively young, healthy people, other research reveals very similar benefits for people struggling with serious challenges. People with neuromuscular disorders, which cause joint and muscle pain as well as muscle atrophy, who write about things they are grateful for in their daily lives show greater satisfaction and more optimism. Women with breast cancer who spend ten minutes a day writing about their gratitude toward someone in their life show better psychological well-being as well as better adaptation to cancer. These findings all tell us that focusing on what you are grateful for has real and substantial benefits, even among people struggling with serious, even life-threatening health conditions.This year it’s my turn to host the annual family gathering, and I’m feeling very grateful that our tradition has continued. My family includes a diverse range of people: meat-eaters and vegetarians, Southerners and Northerners, Republicans and Democrats. We share allegiances to different sports teams and almost definitely voted differently in this year’s midterm elections.But we’re family — and this year will add yet another set of Thanksgiving memories, from putting out a brush fire that nearly got dangerously out of control in my grandmother’s yard to canoeing on a river in Northern Florida to eating deep dish pizza in Chicago. And I’m grateful not only for another year of creating memories with aunts and uncles and cousins, but also for my wisdom in ordering the entire meal from Whole Foods."

The biggest bottleneck for large language model startups is UX,Davis Treybig,Nov 2,https://medium.com/innovationendeavors/the-biggest-bottleneck-for-large-language-model-startups-is-ux-ef4500e4e786?source=home---------49------------------0----------,"Applied large language model startups have exploded in the past year. Enormous advances in underlying language modeling technology, coupled with the early success of products like Github CoPilot, have led to a huge array of founders using LLMs to rethink workflows ranging from code reviews to copywriting to analyzing unstructured product feedback.Much has been written about this emerging ecosystem — I would recommend the excellent articles by Elad Gil, Leigh Marie Braswell, and Vinay Iyengar as starting points — and in general, it is exciting to see so many nascent startups in this area. However, I worry that many startups in this space are focusing on the wrong things early on. Specifically, after having met and looked into numerous companies in this space, it seems that UX and product design is the predominant bottleneck holding back most applied large language model startups, not data or modeling.This article will explain why I think this is the case, highlight many of the key UX issues I observe, and offer recommendations for how a founder building on top of LLMs might account for this.To start, let me paint a picture of the common journey I see many language model startups go through.A technically superb founding team starts with a vision of a big use case that can be obviously re-imagined with current language model technology. They throw together a pitch deck that looks something like the following:90% of the team’s early focus is on data, modeling, system architecture, and technical defensibility. The team is likely hyper-aware of the fact that many people believe LLMs are becoming commoditized, and as a result, tries to spend a lot of time articulating why their technical approach is unique and not easily mimicked by a hobbyist just using GPT-3.After fundraising and a lot of time building, the startup eventually gets an MVP of the product together and puts it in front of customers. The demo blows prospects away, but then, things seem to fade. The prospect tries it out in a POC, but the novelty runs out, and they stop using it. Engagement is low. The customer churns. Despite how incredible the demo is, the startup struggles to find real product market fit.In my experience, the root cause that typically drives this outcome is that it is extraordinarily hard to teach a human how to work together with a probabilistic system in an environment where they are not used to one. Any language model startup that is designed to be human-in-the-loop (which is the vast majority) will need to implicitly answer the following types of questions for their users:These are, first and foremost, UX questions that require very careful design thinking and user research to solve. If you forgo such work and simply throw a naked GPT-3 text prompt into your UI, or just make a raw API call to the GPT-3 API every time the user presses a given hotkey, you are essentially asking the user to figure these things out on their own. The cognitive burden on users to figure such questions out via trial and error is immense. So if you don’t identify how to craft your product in a way that makes these answers so obvious to your users that they can get it in <5 minutes, they are very likely to give up on your product once the novelty effect wears off.In my experience, despite these UX questions being the critical bottleneck to product market fit and the hardest thing to get right in most cases, they are chronically undervalued by most startups in this space. Indeed, if you speak with some of the few companies who have actually built widely adopted applied LLM products, you’ll find that almost universally they ended up having to spend more time on UX and the human-computer interface as they did on modeling.I believe there are a few underlying factors that lead so many teams to pay such little attention to these sorts of UX questions despite their criticality.First, these issues really only surface once someone starts trying to use the product in the context of their daily workflow. This market is characterized by an immense gap between a prospect being impressed or interested in a demo to actually converting to a paid and engaged user for precisely this reason. I believe this is also why many of the PLG and self-service applied LLM startups have high churn — on first use, the product is “cool,” but after some time, you realize it is too difficult to use effectively.Second, many teams believe that improved model accuracy can allow them to avoid deeply considering these questions from a product & design perspective. Unfortunately, these challenges are essentially always present, regardless of your system’s accuracy (within some bounds). It doesn’t really matter if your LLM accuracy is 80% or 95%, as in either case, the user still needs to reason through failure modalities and understand what to expect when interacting with the system. Since you’re almost certainly not going to achieve 100% accuracy unless you have scoped down the use case to something extremely specific, you are generally better off getting to a baseline accuracy that is good enough and then building a product that allows a user to know how to work around the model (this paper on using language models to help write short stories is an excellent illustration of this concept).Finally, there is a talent issue — most of the people building in this space come from research, Ph.D., or engineering backgrounds and simply don’t consider product and design decisions like this as first-class problems to solve.To further explain why the UX of interfacing with LLMs is so hard to get right, let’s briefly explore one of the most popular emerging LLM use cases — copywriting. There are a number of notable companies utilizing GPT-3 or similar models for copywriting, such as Jasper.ai, Copy.ai, and Anyword. At a high level, these products all work in the following way — you tell it what you’re trying to write (e.g. advertising header), you provide some context (e.g. product description), and it generates suggestions for you which theoretically convert users at a high rate.If you try these products yourself or speak to people who use them, you’ll find that the chief factor that differentiates them is not model accuracy. All of them are pretty good at optimizing copy for conversion, and frankly, it is not possible for a user to meaningfully compare the quality of the output copy without putting extensive time into manually A/B testing the services. In other words — differences in model accuracy are essentially imperceptible to the user. What does immediately differentiate the products from a user’s perspective, however, is the “periphery” of the product around the core language synthesis engine.For example:Solving these sorts of UX questions well has a substantially larger impact on a user’s ability to select good copy that they are happy with than marginally fine-tuning a language model to be slightly better at copywriting suggestions.Indeed, many companies in this category have high churn, and I suspect that the vast majority of variance in churn/retention/engagement across such startups is driven by these UX-related factors. Products that handle them poorly are fun to try, but difficult to trust and hard to reason about over time. Products that handle them well are magical — using them feels effortless, and it is clear to understand how they fit into a real workflow.At this point, I’ve hopefully convinced you that it is important to think about the UX of how a human will interact with an LLM in the context of your product. But how might you actually go about doing that, and what are the right design patterns?While this space is extraordinarily early, and there is a lot to be figured out, I want to share some common themes I see emerging in the hope that it sparks your imagination and gets you thinking. For each, I’ll reference several emerging startups that are doing interesting things in the context of that UX pattern.If you’ve ever used Gmail, you have likely come across the “smart compose” feature. As you type a sentence, Gmail occasionally flashes a suggested auto-complete in grey. The user can either quickly accept it or keep typing and ignore it.This feature is quite delightful to use because it is simple to understand, very accurate, and requires zero cognitive effort on the part of the user. I would argue that most of these benefits stem from the fact that these suggestions are system-prompted, not user-prompted. Suggestions are only shown when there is confidence that the result is very high quality, and the “push” based nature of the suggestions means that the user does not even need to be aware that this feature exists to utilize it.Although smart compose is not technically built using LLMs, I would argue that these principles very cleanly translate to most LLM startups. The more you can move away from a user-driven invocation of the model to an automatic triggering of the model in the right instances, the more you can ensure that model output is perceived to be extremely trustworthy and high quality, and the less work you are asking the user to do. In your product, if it is critical to give the user more flexibility on when and how to trigger the model, I would explore different ways to “hint” to the user when the model is more likely to be effective or accurate vs. not.An emerging area of research within language models is the field of “prompt engineering.” Researchers have realized that for a wide class of language model tasks, changing the way you prompt the model results in a massive delta in the accuracy of the model’s results.A fun example of this is that if you ask language models to solve math problems, simply adding the phrase “Let’s think step by step” results in much higher accuracy.The fact that there is an entire research field around prompt engineering hints at a broader point — it is really, really complex to figure out how to interface with a large language model, and subtle differences in the way you “speak” with it can have a massive impact on how useful it is. The critical implication of this is you don’t want to force users of your product to be prompt engineering researchers.Unfortunately, this is the status quo for interacting with foundation models in most products today. In language generation, most products expose fairly “naked” text boxes, and the user is left trying to test and experiment with what creates a good output. One automated email follow-up tool I tried still required me to type “Write an email…” as the start of my prompt to get a good output.To the extent possible, I would strongly encourage building an abstraction layer between what the user inputs and what you actually prompt the model with. A simple but good example of this is TattoosAI, which is a tattoo image generation application. Note that the user interface has abstracted things like style, color, and artist into categorical drop-downs and specific fields. Under the hood, the product clearly converts those categorical values into very specific prompts, which generate good tattoo results. This would otherwise be extraordinarily difficult for a user to get right on their own by directly prompting a model like Stable Diffusion.I suspect that, in many cases, it is not a good idea to provide a single open text field input as the primary way a user interfaces with your model. This likely gives too much freedom to your user and, as a result, opens them up to too many weird failure modalities based on not knowing the right way to talk to the model. Instead, identify constrained, defined situations where the model should be queried and productize that in such a way that the user hopefully can’t mess it up.One of the biggest hurdles to overcome when building an LLM-based application is trust. As a user, to what extent can I default assume the output is good, versus to what extent do I need to double-check the output? The more the user needs to validate everything that the machine produces, the less the machine is actually providing any value.Code autocompletion is an interesting case study in this context. Products like Github CoPilot and Replit AI mode are some of the earliest breakout use cases of large language models — CoPilot has hundreds of thousands of subscribers paying over $100 a year for the service, and many people love the product.Yet, if you talk to a wide enough sample of people who use CoPilot, you will sometimes hear mixed feedback. Specifically, CoPilot regularly suggests code snippets that are incorrect and doesn’t compile or contain errors, meaning that engineers must very carefully analyze code suggestions before moving forward. Essentially, CoPilot introduces a tradeoff between spending less time writing boilerplate code and spending more time reading “someone else’s” code (aka the LLM).It is very interesting to contrast this with Google’s recent work in LLM-based code autocompletion. Specifically, Google has built a hybrid code completion system that is not only based on transformer models but also incorporates semantic engines, which are essentially the rule-based auto-complete systems that have traditionally powered code suggestions in IDEs. The combination of these systems allows for two forms of advanced auto-complete that significantly mitigate user trust issues:Interestingly, Google directly tested pure LLM based autocomplete suggestions and found that there was a much lower user acceptance rate for them due to trust issues:This leads to a common drawback of ML-powered code completion whereby the model may suggest code that looks correct but doesn’t compile. Based on internal user experience research, this issue can lead to the erosion of user trust over time while reducing productivity gains….The acceptance rate for single-line completions improved by 1.9x over the first six weeks of incorporating the feature, presumably due to increased user trust. As a comparison, for languages where we did not add semantic checking, we only saw a 1.3x increase in acceptance.Replit’s AI mode follows similar principles — “We apply a collection of heuristic filters to decide to discard, truncate or otherwise transform some suggestions; soon, we’ll also apply a reinforcement learning layer to understand the kinds of suggestion that are helpful to users, filtering out suggestions that are unlikely to be accepted to prioritize suggestions that are genuinely helpful.Generalizing this, I find that many best-in-class LLM-based products complement the LLM with some form of validation checks (often heuristic in nature) to avoid errant output. It can be catastrophic to suggest something to a user that seems nonsensical or obviously wrong. So especially if you have a product that allows a user to trigger the model in arbitrary situations, it often becomes essential to build mechanisms to mitigate the chances of this.Of course, not all use cases have validation checks as simple as testing whether code can compile. As such, I would also recommend thinking about affordances you can build that allow the user to know when to gut-check the output as well as how to gut-check the output. This might involve building some testing or evaluation framework that the user can use to define domain-specific tests or invariants that they want to hold, or it might involve workflows that ask the user to test/verify the output and edit it in certain cases.Debuild is a good example of a simple app that has approached validation affordances well. Debuild allows you to create simple web applications with natural language — you start by typing something like “A to-do list that allows me to track, edit, and input tasks in a hierarchical format,” and it will create a React application based on this. Importantly, the workflow of the application natively incorporates debugging, testing, and validation steps. After you type the initial natural language prompt, rather than take you straight to the output, it takes you through a number of intermediate validation steps. For example — it shows you a list of “use cases” it believes your app needs to support based on the natural language prompt, and it allows you to edit/modify that list before moving on.This step-by-step, validation-oriented workflow takes a use case that would likely otherwise be way too frustrating — as there is too much room for the LLM to get things wrong if you try to do everything at once — and makes it very delightful. As a user, I implicitly understand when I am expected to validate the output and how I am expected to do that, and as a result, I don’t really mind if the machine sometimes is a little bit wrong.Related to this, I think there is a lot of room for LLM-based products to explore richer error messaging and fallback workflows. Rather than defaulting to always showing the model output, explore whether there are ways to predict or guess when the output may be low quality or uncertain. In such instances, see if you can do something different from a product perspective. This might involve sanitizing the user input and throwing an error message if the user prompt is too “weird” in one way or another. It might involve analyzing the confidence of the LLM’s response and either not showing the response or showing it with a warning if the confidence is too low (with the caveat that the “proper” way to analyze the confidence level of an LLM inference is an active area of research which is still not well understood). It might involve analyzing the output and putting the user into a fallback “you need to check this output” workflow under certain situations. I think there is a lot of design space to be explored here.Most generative products built around LLMs today are “stateless” in the sense that you provide an input, you get an output, and nothing about that interaction influences the future behavior of the model.Yet, in my experience, this structure does not align well with how humans like to approach creative thinking. The creative process is typically much more iterative, with each step derived from the last. For example:In this sense, creative idea generation is often “stateful” — each step plays off the last step’s output. I suspect most applied LLM products focused on creative generation or synthesis will likely benefit from treating user interactions more like sessions where the user can see some initial outputs, highlight what they like or don’t like, and then further nudge the model in the direction they want the output to go.Many emerging LLM-based copywriting tools are starting to do basic versions of this. Copy.ai allows you to pick initial suggestions you like and generate “More like this,” while Anyword allows you to highlight outputs and “rephrase” them, which changes the wording but preserves the core meaning.You can imagine many more sophisticated versions of this, where the system allows you to very elegantly define what characteristics you like in certain outputs (wording, tone, style, structure, length, etc), as well as what types of changes you want to make. These sorts of features offer users a much greater feeling of control and help users avoid the frustrations that can stem from re-prompting the model from scratch and “losing” something you liked a lot but which was just a little bit off.The fact that accuracy and trust will be an issue for many of these models greatly exacerbates the importance of this concept. If you build in the right affordances for the user to deal with “bad” output and select for “good” output via an iterative process, you drastically reduce the perceived negative impact of bad suggestions. Implicitly, this design tells the user not to expect that the model’s output will be perfect and gives them the tools to deal with that. This is a much more realistic mental model for how a user should interact with the LLM in most situations.Some of the most delightful implementations of LLMs that I have used thus far are built to solve extremely specific and narrow workflows, such as AutoRegex, which converts English to regular expressions, and Warp’s tool for converting natural language to CLI commands. Both of these tools tackle an extremely narrow subset of language generation, and the result is compelling. The model essentially always does exactly what you expect it to do as a user, the perceived accuracy is very high, and there is no confusion as a user about how to prompt, trigger or use the model.When you compare this with more general products, such as LLM-based text editors like Lex, the difference in user experience is profound. While Lex is extremely cool and fun to use, to me, it still feels much closer to a novelty and much further from a core tool that I can use day to day. It is simply too challenging to understand when to trigger the model and to guess what it will write.Many startups in this space have begun to realize this. If you look at the evolution of the LLM-based copywriting products, many have gone from more general copywriting interfaces to highly segmented UIs for very specific copywriting use cases— e.g., Copy.ai has different parts of the product for writing “Facebook Primary Text,” “Facebook Headlines,” and “Facebook Link Descriptions.” In the automated code review space, I see many of the best startups starting by focusing on specific code ecosystems (e.g., Rust) and specific classes of code review use cases (e.g., style errors).The most commonly discussed benefit of specificity is that it may allow for a more specialized, fine-tuned model to be used, leading either to performance improvements or a latency/cost reduction. While this is certainly true, it is far from the only benefit. Constraining the use case also allows you to make much more opinionated product and UX decisions at the interface between the model and the human and abstract much more of the model prompting and model output.For example, many companies working on analyzing unstructured user feedback via LLMs, such as Viable and Enterpret have moved away from highly prompt-driven user interfaces where a user can ask whatever they want. Instead, they focus more on “out of the box,” segmented use cases such as trending negative feedback or new feedback tied to a specific recent release of the product. This approach removes the need for the user to identify what to ask the model as well as the right way to prompt it — the user doesn’t need to come up with the idea that analyzing trending negative feedback might be a good idea, nor do they need to figure out the right way to ask the model to provide trending negative feedback.In coding, there is also a clear trend toward workflow specificity. Replit treats rewriting code, explaining code, and generating code as completely distinct use cases from both a UI perspective and from a model perspective. Some products are beginning to further segment even within code generation, treating full-function code completion based on a function signature (e.g., have the LLM write a function based on a comment) as distinct from in-line code autocomplete (e.g., guess the rest of the line of code I am writing) in terms of how they surface in the UI or are triggered.Similarly, I suspect that most LLM-based word editors will, over time, move away from utilizing a hotkey command as the universal way to trigger an LLM, and move towards much more cleanly defined use cases that are visually surfaced in distinct ways or triggered via different mechanisms. Paragraph generation, sentence or phrase auto-complete, rewording/rewriting, information gathering, and having the model help you “brainstorm” what to write are likely quite distinct in how they should be productized; the Worldcraft paper on short story writing has some great illustrations and examples of this. While segmenting these use cases will certainly allow for individual models to be fine-tuned, I suspect that most of the marginal benefit comes from a simpler-to-understand product that is easier to use, trust, and interface with.The last UX principle worth touching on is latency and performance. Many of the most interesting applied LLM use cases live in the context of a “flow state” task like writing, coding, or similar, which you ideally do not want to interrupt with a loading spinner that lasts 5 seconds. If you are building an LLM-based application, it is worth deeply studying the latency thresholds that your use cases will require to achieve a good UX. From there, you can identify the right model and system architecture.For example, TabNine is a code completion startup that has a very different architecture than Github CoPilot — rather than utilizing one monolithic language model, their product is built around an ensemble of specific models fine-tuned for different types of tasks. Notably, utilizing much smaller models allows them to do inline, real-time code suggestions as you type each character, something CoPilot can not achieve.Replit, similarly, has done extensive optimization work to get their median response time to 400ms. I suspect that virtually all generative writing LLM use cases will benefit massively from hitting the 100ms threshold over time.Although performance improvements are obviously technical in nature, my argument would be that they really need to start from a deep understanding of the user, the user’s workflow, and the user experience you want to create. There is a huge design space of ways to modulate the cost, speed, size, and accuracy tradeoff of language models— selecting different baseline pre-trained models, fine-tuning, prefix tuning, etc. — and in many applications, there are likely pareto optimal points in this search space that should be identified.Tied to this, I suspect that in many cases, there will be other innovative ways to drive performance, such as intelligent use of caching, parallelization of compute, utilizing an ensemble of models (including some small language models or traditional model architectures), clever integrations between semantic/heuristic checks and the language model, and similar. Subtle UX changes can often also result in dramatic differences in perceived performance and should not be discounted. As an example, Replit has its code completion models “stream” the results line by line for multi-line suggestions rather than wait until the whole response can be shown. This results in a very different user perception of speed and a vastly improved UX.The best applied LLM startups will have very strong opinions about where they should sit among these tradeoffs and will likely identify clever system architectures to achieve a differentiated user experience.Many people starting LLM-based companies think a lot about building proprietary data moats or data feedback loops that allow for data or model-driven defensibility over time. I generally think that for the majority of vertical use cases within LLMs, it will be hard to achieve any substantive advantage in this manner — these models are obviously becoming commoditized, and the benefits of marginal accuracy beyond a certain point for most of these use cases are limited, and in many situations, there is enough easily accessible or open data.It is commonly believed that product and UX insights do not generally drive defensibility, given they are easily copied. If one of the copywriting companies figures out the perfect workflow for LLM-assisted copywriting, can’t the other quickly mimic that? While this is true to an extent, it misses something — many UX insights in this space need to be coupled with unique, domain-specific technical work to enable them. Examples of this that have already been touched on in this article include Google’s semantic validation engine for its code completion system and TabNine’s ensemble approach to language modeling to allow for inline code suggestions while the developer types.Superhuman is a good illustrative example of this in a different domain. A lot of what makes Superhuman special is how fast everything is, enabling the user to stay in a flow state, but this was only achieved via extreme engineering effort to ensure every single action in the product happens in <100 ms.I am certain that many applied LLM teams that start by identifying the ideal user experience for their use case will need to do research-level work in explainability, confidence analysis, prompt engineering, performance, testing, and validation, or similar to actually build that user experience. Domain-specific context integration, fine-tuning customer data, and continuous learning are some other interesting areas for unique IP to be developed that will enable improved user experiences. This sort of domain-specific, “user-aware” research is often the hardest type of technical progress for others to duplicate or mimic. Related, I suspect that many enduring startups in this space will build out complex hybrid systems that combine heuristics, symbolic approaches, transformer-based models, and legacy language models in an elegant way.Great startups in this category will think from first principles about the UX they want to deliver and identify truly novel ways to achieve that technically in a way that few others can. The more specific these UX insights are to a specific domain, the better, as the less likely they are to be obviated by general research improvements in large language models.In some sense, much of what I have written about in this article is not particularly new. The central issue of teaching a human how to interact with a probabilistic machine has been true for the vast majority of applied ML companies over the last decade. In each case, you need to figure out how to build a product that “gracefully handles the confusion matrix” and engender trust among the users interacting with the model. Indeed, I think many LLM companies can likely learn an immense amount from the best-in-class ML-enabled creative tools that exist today, such as Runway.Yet, I can’t help but feel that these problems are even harder to solve and more critical to get right in the applied LLM space. This heavily relates to the ambition of startups in this category. It is, frankly, incredible to even consider the idea that machines can so foundationally influence complex, creative, knowledge-worker tasks like writing software. The scope of these tasks is, to some extent, much broader than most previously applied AI workflows, which dramatically increases the importance of creating carefully tuned products with outstanding UX, especially at the interface of the model and the human.It is worth noting that many of these UX questions can be tested, de-risked, and iterated on with a very small amount of money. You can build a hacky prototype with a hard-coded backend to test the interaction pattern — no LLM is required. I think far more startups in the space should do things like this before they build a huge language model stack. Think through all the different ways a user could interact with the product and reason through ways to address the questions I posed at the start of the article. Take an off-the-shelf LLM model and focus on refining the UX of interacting with the product before you try to do anything custom from an architecture or fine-tuning perspective. These are not hard things to do, but so few teams do them.This space desperately needs more founding teams with strong design and product instincts who treat UX as a first-class problem. The foundational interaction patterns for using LLMs have not been figured out, and there is a big opportunity for the startups that are at the forefront of this.If you’re a team like this working on an applied LLM startup and thinking a lot about how to get the human-machine interface right, I’d love to chat with you — feel free to reach out at davis (at) innovationendeavors (dot) com."

A n00b’s guide to Mastodon,Jeremy Littau,Nov 8,https://jeremylittau.medium.com/a-n00bs-guide-to-mastodon-806d1b367f2d?source=home---------39------------------0----------,"From “The Axe Forgets” — S1E5 of Andor on Disney+:Star Wars’ Andor is an excellent show, and I’ve been thinking about the scene quoted above the past week as Twitter has become a less-stable place. In that episode, Cassian Andor is speaking with Nemic, a true believer in the rebellion against the Empire. They were training for a raid on an Imperial base and Nemic was working on a computer navigator that would help their ship handle the escape. The navigator was decidedly Old Tech, like old cars from the ’50s and ’60s that were less complicated and easy to fix. Sure, new cars have more bells and whistles and do fancier things, but Nemic’s point was there is value to understanding the tech tool you rely on so much. When you know how to build and tinker with the tools you need, you don’t depend on someone to fix it when it breaks. You are free to use it as you like, and free to not take the easier path of an alternate tool where your use is constrained by what you’re toldIn essence, it’s a simple idea. There’s a tradeoff when we outsource building and management of critical tools to others. The tools get more complicated, harder to understand, and harder to solve when things go wrong. This is not to laud simplicity per se — old cars are fixable, but those fancy computers on modern models help us guzzle less gas and keep people more safe! Rather, the model is there to help us see the trade so we can choose clearly. To know when we’ve indulged convenience too much and swung too far in one direction between freedom and control.The purpose of this newsletter issue is to explain Mastodon, one of the emerging alternatives to Twitter. It’s had a hell of a week, nearly doubling its daily active users in the wake of the the Twitter’s sale to Elon (it had a bit over 1 million active monthly users as of the morning of Nov. 7). But Mastodon has a difficult learning curve and does not “look like” the Twitter interface we’ve gotten comfortable with over the years, and in a time when familiarity and use of a digital product can be one in the same, that matters a lot in making adoption less difficult. People are confused by what Mastodon is and by some of the explanations …… and so I wanted to write an explainer from the point of view of someone new to Mastodon, to help demystify it a bit and encourage you to check it out if you’re a heavy Twitter user looking for possible exits.Before I do that, though, I want to talk about how we got here.Longtime readers of this newsletter know I spend a good amount of time writing about the intersection of communication technology and power. Self-publishing created a moment at the turn of the century that shifted power more toward a former audience made up of new creators, but the social network boom era created technologies that asked us to give up those gains in exchange for convenience.We think of social media platforms as places where we can post, watch, view and read. But the fundamental architecture is built around collection and deployment of basic user data. Data, in this case, consists of:Think of of your favorite social app and they pretty much are built around executing functions off these facets of data. Our content, our connections, and the things we enjoyed most become drivers of our experience and that of people around us. The genius model of social platforms is to take the power we reacquired from self-publishing and provide a common platform for us and everyone else to do it, then map it across social connections so that it could spread more easily. But in the background, what this really did was create a common set of relationships that we come to rely on to be heard. In other words, distribution. There’s a difference between publishing and being heard.Being heard requires social relationships. The old blogosphere used blogrolls, links, and recommendations to spread posts. Social platforms mapped our networks and built the recommendation system, then locked us inside it. Anything where we have to do it ourselves, to tinker with it and fix it, starts to feel like Nemic’s old tech.I want you to see something critical here: modern social platforms built that engine for us, but most critically it owns the map of those relationships and can make it easy or difficult to remap them elsewhere. As a platform acquires more users — and make no mistake, that is the only path that makes sense for their growth — the system locks you in because leaving an app means leaving behind all those people you’ve linked up with. If you are on a social app to spread your work or connect with people in areas you care about, the platforms own critical pathways to accomplishing your purpose.If you look at some of the concern over Twitter since the sale was announced earlier this year, a lot of it revolves around the idea that leaving comes at the cost for all the time we spent building connections. It’s the sunk cost fallacy at work, wherein we judge the value of future choices in part based on past investment even if the returns are diminishing and the tradeoffs are ever more tilted against the benefits. It can be hard to leave behind something you’ve spent years building.A real, sustainable reimaginging of a Twitter or Facebook, then, needs to not look at follower counts but rather the underlying architecture that starts with data capture and control. What if we could decouple the platform from the data ownership? What if you exist as a person in an online space, but neither you nor your data are owned by a single platform but rather free to migrate to spaces you find more useful, or welcoming, or interesting?That is the logic of the fediverse, which redesigns social platforms around user control instead of platform control. Mastodon is a fediverse project. BlueSky, which is coming sometime soon, is another one. Instead of the social network being a platform that hosts everything from content to user data, the fediverse uses software that acts as a way to organize a community and create connections between communities without controlling any of it.Like a lot of newly designed things, a Twitter alternative is going to feel less refined. The comfort Nemic spoke of in the lead quote is very real. We get used to a place, get comfortable. An alternative comes along and doesn’t feel right, and so we stay in the old thing we know. Sunk cost. But at some point we look around and see a place trending downward and have to make a choice about whether to stay.I’m staying on Twitter for now, as I’ve said, but I’m building a presence in Mastodon too just in case. But as I’ve looked around for what I’d do if I had to leave Twitter, I’ve centered on the fediverse as the place where I’d invest my time. I can’t migrate to more of the same. I spent a long time cultivating the wonderful community I know on Twitter, but Twitter owns that and it’s made me hesitant to leave that behind. If I have to rebuild, I want to own my data and in turn my experience.I’ve been diving in hard on Mastodon for about 10 days. Because of the learning curve, I wanted to share what I’ve learned so that perhaps it’s easier on the next person. This is not an all-encompassing explainer — that’s why I’ve added links to other sources below that will explain some of this in more and perhaps better detail — but rather a type of FAQ through the eyes of a newbie, detailing answers to questions a newbie might ask when they’re just getting started. Basically enough to get you going so you can learn as you go.I’ve read about Mastodon. It sounds complicated. Can you describe it simply?Mastodon is not a social network, but it gives us the means to create one that we own and manage without a common server controlling everything. Mastodon is software, not a website.Rather than everything being on a central platform, Mastodon is open-source software installed on tens of thousands of servers all over the world that enables someone to create a community. Those servers become like a town square that hosts what you post and share, and you join one based on your interests, needs, and the rules governing them. But there are also connections between those town squares all over the globe. How much you venture out is up to you, but Mastodon owns none of it. It just provides the building materials to make the town and a way of making introductions between communities.Mastodon enables users to create a posting mechanism (your profile) but doesn’t own or host your content. It allows users to join communities (known as “instances”) but doesn’t own those communities. Finally, it sets up the means to build roads between communities so that you can see content outside your town square rather than be isolated (known as “federation”), but it doesn’t own the roads. All the functions of Twitter without central control. Mastodon’s role is making introductions by creating the process for instances to connect by handshake.“Fediverse” sounds daunting, but you already use one. It’s called email. Fediverses are sprawling networks of servers running the same software protocols that let them communicate in a common language.What problem does Mastodon aim to solve?Twitter has always had subcultures. Think of #academicchatter or #BlackTwitter. But these subcultures had fluid boundaries and no control over membership because all of these subcultures were hosted by a single platform. That means Twitter’s rules and moderation are everything, because all these communities are permeable while being on a centralized platform. It also gives communities no control over where they exist, binding them to a platform that might become abusive over time but without any real options to port itself elsewhere.What if instead each of these subcultures could have their own space to set rules, control membership and ban abusers while also not cutting themselves off from other subcultures? By returning control to community owners instead of centralizing control, that’s what Mastodon does. These niche communities become formal communities rather than hashtags anyone can join by using, communities with known membership that control who can join, rules for content, and dealing with abusers on their own terms. It gives them the power to decide to affiliate with other communities, or not. It takes the power away from the central controller and gives control to the people most invested in that space.Who runs instances/servers?First off, in this post I am using “instances,” “servers,” and “communities” here interchangeably. Sometimes I like one word more to help you visualize what I’m talking about, but they are the same thing.Anyhow, instances are run by individuals, mostly. There are some organizations running them, but generally it’s people volunteering their time and money. They installed Mastodon on their private web space much like people install Wordpress on their websites. These people set the rules and run the community, but they don’t decide whether you get to be on Mastodon. They only decide whether you can exist in their particular slice of community.It’s a very good idea to the read the rules before joining. From Fedi.Tips:You’ll want to know the rules before joining, because getting completely banned likely means losing your data forever (there are other softer ways to get banned without data loss, as covered below). But rules are rules. If you don’t like them, find an instance whose rules you can abide.OK so these individuals running instances seem pretty powerful! How are they different from Elon?Well, that’s the thing. The individual owns the server, but you own your posts and data. Individuals can set their rules how they like, being as permissive or restrictive as possible. They can be a total tyrant, absolutely. But with so many servers available, because you own your own data (posts, followers, people you’re following) you can migrate to a new one whose rules you like. Elon says “this is Twitter, deal with it” but Mastodon allows you to find an experience that works more with what you want.Servers set their own rules. That sounds … interestingYeah, there are good communities and bad ones. There are servers devoted to some pretty hateful and extreme stuff. But there also are niche communities around tons of different interests. If you’re old like me, it feels like USENET. If you’re slightly younger, it feels like AOL chatrooms or bulletin boards.But if there are Nazis, how is that different than Twitter?Servers can decide to stay isolated if they want (like a closed online message board), but they can also use those roads to connect to others (known as “federation”). Servers also can also cut off access to particular users, or even entire servers that are toxic, a key way to isolate abusers. Individuals have the power to block people or servers, but so can servers themselves. What this setup does is allow servers to create a better social network architecture.OK, so how do I join Mastodon?You create an account that looks like your Twitter feed. Think of it as a blog. Hey, did you know that in the early days of media studies, we referred to Twitter as a “microblogging service?” Everything old is new.Once you’ve created an account, you’ll need to join an instance (aka “server”). This makes you a part of a community, so that when you post the posts go out to that community as well as on your profile page. That’s why I think online message boards are a nice reference point for Mastodon.But just as with Twitter, you also can follow people not on your server, and they can do likewise. This is federation in action, those roads that allow content to travel between communities.The Mastodon home page. Your feed is in the middle, and the links to Local, Federated, and Notifications content (among other things are at the right. Seems sort of Twitter-like, yes?When you join, you’ll have access to a Local Timeline that is all the posts in the community you joined. There’s also a Federated Timeline, which is posts from all the different servers your community is aware of. How does it become aware of them? Every time someone in an instance follows someone on a different server, your community becomes aware of them. So the Federated Timeline is built by community members, via their interests. That this has to happen is sort of an example of how Mastodon is designed. The software is all over the Web, but those servers don’t talk to one another unless someone tries to shake hands across servers. It’s decentralization, something I wrote about last month, in action.So how does Mastodon function differently than Twitter?On Twitter, when you post it gets posted to:On Mastodon, when you post it gets posted to:So you see the difference? There is no all-encompassing Mastodon. Your posts’ reach is limited to your community and followers and their followers. The key difference is you’re not going to show up in search because you’re not on a single platform. Now, for some this might be a deal-breaker. They rely on Twitter for exposure, and the wider the opportunity for reach the better. This is the tradeoff between quality and quantity.What else?“Tweets” are “toots” on Mastodon. I will not be using this term because I’m a self-respecting man.The community choice at signup seems pretty daunting. How do I choose?I like the Instances Wizard tool as a first crack at it. Most of us are choosing the suggested mastodon.social instance first to get our feet wet. As you find other people to follow across servers, you’ll learn about other ones. Remember, you can switch to a new server any time because you own your own data (link below on how to do that).One big thing to consider is that, again, every server has rules and you have no say in them (unless the admin chooses to involve the community in the rulemaking). Some servers might be ok with general chatter, but a niche server might want you to stay on topic. If you’re one of those types that has specific interests but likes to talk about anything on your mind, be aware of the rules. When you look to join a server, the community rules should be posted from that page. You definitely should read them and keep them in mind as you post.Finding followers seems pretty hardBefore I get there, allow me to gently suggest you build slowly and thoughtfully. There’s always a mad rush to populate your timeline, but that often comes with later regrets. Go slow. Anyhow …What other critical things have you learned the past week that aren’t hella obvious to a n00b?Great question.Those are kind of serious lessons. Any lighter-hearted tips?Do I need to join Mastodon? I’m kind of stuck in my ways.Nope! You can certainly wait to see what Twitter ends up being. I am keeping a foot in both camps. This is a time to play around with the possibility of a new space and build community before the one you like gets wrecked.So what’s your best pitch on why I should join?One thing I’ll say is the past week has been illuminating how much, as Nemic said, that I came to rely on Twitter as a singular source to control my experience. Most of my process was automated. I was less intentional in building community. I stopped using hashtags because #some #peoples #use #of #them #was #beyond #parody. #factWhen we aren’t actively building and designing our experience, someone does it for us. That becomes the window by which we see the world, and also puts some constraints on what we think is or should be possible on a platform. Ten days on Mastodon has taught me we could have and should have been demanding much more.My past week on Mastodon has felt very much like my early days on Twitter in 2007–08. I’m learning what the network is, what the norms are, how to interact, and how to find people. I’m using hashtags to find communities. A lot of the chatter on there right now is “how to use Mastodon” chatter, which reminds me of the old days on Twitter when a lot of the talk was tips and tricks before it gave way to everyday conversation.There’s another level Mastodon needs to get to. I remember Clay Shirky hosting a session at SXSW over 10 years ago and saying something that has always stuck with me about new technology. You’ll know a new technology has become ubiquitous, he said, when we stop talking about the wonders of the new tech and start doing things with it that cause their own stories. In the early days, Twitter was the main topic on Twitter (and thanks to Elon, that seems to be the case again, sadly). But once it grew and became ubiquitous, what people were doing with Twitter and what we could learn from one another became the experience, became the way we thought of the platform itself. A lot of the sadness about what’s happening on Twitter is about that, about those stories we’ve created and told ourselves. But anyhow, Mastodon is not there yet, and it’ll be a minute before it is. This is normal when you’re building something new, but already there are pockets of non Mastodon/Twitter conversation among the people I follow. It’s happening. The academic migration is already underway, and I suspect other niche communities are going to follow. Maybe not to Mastodon, but somewhere if Twitter continues on a less-safe path.Finally, I have come to value the slowness that is a feature/bug of Mastodon and realized what it’s like to detox from a platform built to feed me new things constantly via an algorithm. With Mastodon you get the most recent posts first, and because of that it appears things are slower than they are. Corporate platforms are in the business of keeping you engaged and coming back, so they use algorithms to serve up recent-ish things you missed so everything feels new. This is another example of what I mean by the comfort of what’s known. I forgot what it was like to not feel like I needed to check constantly about what’s new.I want to know where you gathered a lot of this information. Gimme the links, manYup. Some of this I’ve learned by hacking my way through it, but I’ve found a lot of helpful tips, explainers, stories and lists.

The Bird Is Fried,Dave Pell,Oct 29,https://davepell.medium.com/the-bird-is-fried-3c66d868abc5?source=home---------81------------------0----------,"Oh, what Elon strange trip it’s been. After months of top of the news wrangling, Elon Musk celebrated the purchase of the company he was essentially forced to buy with the tweet, “The bird is freed.” So why do I feel like our goose is cooked? Journalists make up a large proportion of Twitter’s most active users and work in the world’s most self-gazing profession, so you’ll be seeing nonstop, top-of-the-page headlines about each move Musk makes at Twitter — which already includes the predictable firing of top execs — so I’ll spare you the blow by blow.Speaking of blow… In 1979, Victor Kiam appeared in a commercial for Remington shavers in which he proclaimed, “I liked the razor so much I bought the company.” That’s similar to the Musk/Twitter story, but Scarface is probably a closer analog. It was Michelle Pfeiffer’s Elvira Hancock who warned Al Pacino’s Tony Montana, “Don’t get high on your own supply.” Tony didn’t listen. Neither did Elon. Musk is a Twitter addict. This comment falls into the category of it takes one to know one. I’m a Twitter addict, too. Most of the platform’s active users are.Several years ago, I started using an app from Twitter called TweetDeck to track my likes and retweets — they call tools like these social media dashboards, but they’re better understood as the vital signs for an internet dopamine junkie. One of the options in the app is to hear a shrill, school alarm bell sound anytime anyone interacts with one of your tweets.Out of curiosity, I enabled the feature. The first ring startled. The second one went down a little easier. The third ring calmed. And after that, I needed the fourth ring. When the alarm bells went off in quick succession, it felt good, like a song I wanted stuck in my head. So, that day, I decided to leave the feature on for a little while.That was about a decade ago. Since then, anytime someone responds to me, mentions me, retweets me, likes one of my tweets, shares anything re- lated to my newsletter, NextDraft, or links to any of my other writing online, I hear the ring. And I experience a positive response each time. Ring, response. Ring, response. It’s like someone forgot to pick up after Pavlov’s dog.The bell has sounded so often, and has become such a pervasive source of background music in my house, that no one in my family ever even mentions it. It would be more noticeable if my laptop were open and there was no ringing. Every now and then, during a quiet, dry spell, one of my kids will hold a finger under my nose to make sure I’m still breathing.I’m a small-fry, just one of the millions of middling addicts. For guys like Musk, with more than a hundred million followers, the dopamine hits are like tidal waves. So he kept tweeting. He kept tweeting when it hurt his reputation, even among prospective Tesla buyers. He kept tweeting when it led to nasty lawsuits or huge SEC fines. Even with all the fame, pressure, and influence associated with being the world’s richest (and maybe most famous) person, Musk couldn’t resist the blue tweet button. It was this Twitter addiction that led Musk to publicly ponder the possibility of purchasing the platform. That thread got him in so deep he was ultimately forced to wildly overpay for a company that will endlessly distract him from the several other much more impressive companies to run. Now that’s a Twitter addiction. (On the plus side, I’m so bummed that Musk owns Twitter, it may actually help me kick my own habit.)Twitter is a bloated company that has often been poorly managed, both on the product and revenue fronts. So Musk and his fellow investors may very well see financial upside at some point. But, as it was for Tony Montana, the psychological upside will prove more elusive. $44 billion is too much to pay to own the libs. I keep picturing Musk at Twitter HQ yelling, “Say hello to my little friend.” But when you look, he’s just holding an iPhone with the Twitter app open.From Dave Pell’s Free Newsletter, NextDraft."
How AI Could Help Preserve Art,Salvatore Raieli,Oct 22,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-ai-could-help-preserve-art-f40c8376781d?source=home---------96------------------0----------,"In recent months there has been talk about how artificial intelligence can create images from textual prompts. Therefore, when one associates the words artificial intelligence and art, one immediately thinks of DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and other algorithms. In this article, instead, I want to discuss why artworks are often less safe than we think, and how artificial intelligence can help preserve them.It is a mistake to think that cultural heritage is safe. Many of humanity’s most valuable works are also among the most fragile. Throughout history, only a fraction of works of art has managed to survive over time.For example, during wars, cultural heritage is often damaged. During antiquity, it was considered common practice to loot newly conquered territories, a tradition that was maintained during colonialism and Napoleonic plundering. In addition, during World War II a huge number of works of art were damaged or lost forever. Several works were stolen by the Nazis (and never found again), while others were destroyed during the Allied-led bombing raids on Germany.Even today, during the war in Syria, millennia-old cities such as Aleppo have been brutally destroyed (more than 70% of the city according to the UN). Not to mention the acts of terrorist groups that destroyed and looted Palmyra and Iraq’s museums (often many of these works were resold to buy weapons). In addition, dictatorial regimes have often destroyed important works of art even in recent times (Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban).In addition, many works were destroyed or damaged during natural events. Often events such as earthquakes or other natural disasters lead to the loss of valuable works. During the Florence Flood of November 4, 1966, thousands of precious and ancient manuscripts were covered with mud and heavily damaged (some are still being restored). Cimabue’s precious crucifix, a 14th-century work, was also affected by the flood and required delicate restoration. Even today, many areas are at risk of flooding, and the phenomenon of acqua alta (high water) is a risk to Venice.During the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon in 1755, a great many valuable ancient volumes kept in the Royal Library were lost (along with works by Titian, Rubens, Correggio, and Caravaggio). In addition, many works were lost in the fire of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734 (priceless works by Velazquez, Rubens, Bosch, Brueghel, Van Dyck, El Greco, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and many others). Even today, fires like the one at the National Museum of Brazil in 2018 or the one at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019 demonstrate how such destructive events can still happen.In addition, some natural phenomena that cause damage to artworks are caused by human activities. In fact, pollution and climate change put artistic and architectural heritage at risk. For example, acid rain is accelerating the erosion of the Egyptian Sphinx, but it is also a serious problem for marble buildings. Rising temperatures are thought to be catalyzing chemical reactions by increasing damage to historic buildings.There are also accidental events in which artwork was lost (airplane crashes and other forms of transportation). In 2006, a man fell after stepping on his loose shoelace at the Fitzwilliam Museum (Cambridge) destroying three 17th-century Chinese vases. While in 2010, a woman fell on a Picasso painting at the Metropolitan Museum damaging it (a painting valued at $130 million and considered one of his masterpieces). In 2000, a Sotheby’s employee disposed of a box using a crushing machine, only the box was not empty but contained a Lucian Freud painting.In addition, the neglect of artworks is also a serious problem. Frescoes, ancient paintings, statues, and monuments are fragile works, so maintenance and restoration are expensive and delicate operations. In 2012, the restoration of a painting by an amateur restorer in Spain caused a stir (but there are other examples such as the “potato head” of Palencia).In addition, we could also add neglect (such as the collapses caused in Pompeii), vandals and madmen (such as the man who damaged Michelangelo’s Pietà), art trafficking, economical interest (for example, when building dams), and other causes as well. That is why UNESCO, which reviewed the World Heritage Sites, also keeps a less prestigious list where the heritage sites that are at risk are included.The destruction of a work of art goes beyond the mere economic value of the work. When it was done intentionally in both ancient and modern times it was to erase the memory of a people (whether religious or cultural). In recent times, these same mechanisms have been used to destroy archaeological remains in Bosnia, Syria, and Afghanistan (considered contrary to religious doctrine). Moreover, the debate is more topical than ever as, for example, those who call for the return of goods stolen during colonialism (e.g., the famous Benin bronzes that represent the history of the nation and have been scattered in European museums) claim.As we have seen, heritage is at risk from natural phenomena but also from political choices when funds earmarked for preservation are cut. There is a civic duty in all of us in protecting what is our memory and this, in my opinion, also extends to data science. In fact, the use of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more democratized and can be used at less cost by anyone for social applications.In short, artistic works are fragile and often more at risk than people think. How can science and artificial intelligence protect them?To begin with, new scientific investigation techniques allow us to learn about the works. Even the greatest artists begin their works with a sketch and often rethink as they go. Today we have several techniques that allow us to analyze pictorial works (such as x-rays), which are not only noninvasive but allow us to tell the story of the work. However, these techniques produce data that are often difficult to interpret (especially with several overlapping images), so machine learning algorithms have been developed for image analysis.X-ray exposure is able to show underdrawings or changes in progress. For example, this showed that Rembrandt fine-tuned the composition of the figures in his masterpiece Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild several times. Leonardo da Vinci himself had drawn angels and other figures before painting The Virgin of the Rocks. Although it can sometimes be easy to be able to identify the artist’s various interventions, there were often several patterns that the artist repainted several times generating several overlapping images. These patterns are difficult to distinguish, and AI helps to be able to reconstruct the different phases of the work.Artificial intelligence has also proven to be useful in restoration. For example, it has been successfully used in digital restoration (photography, articles, and even manuscripts). The MACH laboratory in Cambridge has used AI algorithms to identify damage and virtually reconstruct the images in manuscripts (a process called inpainting). Similar technologies have been used to reconstruct damaged photographs, color black and white photographs, reconstruct the image of frescoes, and so on.As an interesting example, researchers recently reconstructed with AI and projected how Rembrandt’s masterpiece, The Night Watch, must have originally looked (the painting was arbitrarily shortened when it was moved to another site). Furthermore, such a technique can be used to reconstruct works considered lost: for example, two panels are missing from the famous Van Eyck brothers’ Ghent Altarpiece (1432) and researchers have used a convolutional neural network to try to faithfully reconstruct the two panels.The reconstruction of lost paintings is still a controversial application. Indeed, when an attempt was made to recreate lost Klimt paintings with AI (in 1945, three of Klimt’s masterpieces were irretrievably lost), researchers made it clear that the idea was not to replace but to give an idea of what is considered lost forever.Another intriguing use of artificial intelligence is the authentication of paintings by algorithms. Indeed, valuations of works are a huge market and often attributing works is not easy (especially if it is the work of a painter or someone in his workshop). Recently, a method has been proposed whereby by studying the topography of the work, the signature of an author can be reconstructed. In short, the surface height information is recorded (at 50 microns spatial resolution) and then passed through a convolutional neural network (CNN), so that differences in brush strokes can be studied.Similar methods could be very useful for avoiding counterfeits of works of art, even being useful for dating and attributing works. In addition, algorithms that can recognize the signature of work can be useful against artwork trafficking.Artificial intelligence and its applications will also have an impact on archaeology and archaeological heritage.Moreover, X-Ray is not restricted to paintings. In fact, researchers often also analyze objects such as glass (for example, to understand the workmanship), mummies, and statues. In addition, other techniques such as CT scans are also often used. The Antikythera mechanism (mysterious Greek artifact) itself has been analyzed by X-ray to study its possible operation. In all these cases AI algorithms applied to image analysis have proven to be very useful.Another interesting case is palimpsests: parchments or books that were erased by scraping off the ink and then rewritten again (parchment was expensive and was therefore reused by amanuensis monks). Today, erased text can be reconstructed using imaging techniques, allowing us to rediscover masterpieces of antiquity believed lost. Recently, using artificial intelligence and X-rays it has been possible to transcribe to decode the Archimedes Palimpsest (which contains two works of Archimedes thought to be lost).The terrible eruption of 79 AD covered the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with a deluge of ash and lapilli. Beneath this blanket was found a valuable library of papyri (papyri rarely survive the Mediterranean climate). Unfortunately, previous attempts to unroll and decipher them had led to the destruction of the papyri. Fortunately, new imaging techniques make it possible to analyze them without the need to unroll them.The X-ray approach had been successfully attempted with a 1,700-year-old Hebrew parchment found in En-Gedi, Israel. Unfortunately, while the Israeli scroll contained a metal-based ink that showed well on x-rays, the Hercolanus papyri were written with a carbon-based ink, meaning that “there is no obvious contrast between the writing and the papyrus in x-ray scans”. For this, the study authors used more energetic X-rays but also artificial intelligence. The authors used a 3D-convolutional neural network to detect the text and decipher it.Image analysis can also be used to discover unknown archaeological sites. The discovery of an archaeological site is often a fortuitous event (excavation for other reasons) or requires expensive investigation. Indeed, lidar technology (in which one targets an object or a surface with a laser), has been successfully used to detect new archaeological sites (in Mexico the remains of Angamuco were thus found). This technology has also been used to reveal anthropogenic changes to the Angkor landscape. Lidar, thermal images, and satellite images can therefore be analyzed with AI to monitor the status of archaeological sites and study interventions.In the past, these instruments were on helicopters or small planes. Today, however, drones are increasingly popular and allow greater flexibility. For example, one research project used drones to map the ruins of Pompeii. Mapping is the first step to verify which structures are at risk, follow the evolution of the site, and plan priorities for interventions. Furthermore, drones can also be used in difficult areas such as underwater archaeology.As we have seen AI can be used to reconstruct damaged paintings. The same approach can also be used for archaeological artifacts such as mosaics. Recently, a paper was published that presents an interesting approach. The authors tested the “outpainting” capability of OpenAI’s DALL-E (the AI takes as input an incomplete image and fills in the missing parts). They tested them either with mosaics that were already damaged (both figurative and geometrically patterned) or by artificially removing parts of well-preserved mosaics, so they could compare the results.The approach and results are intriguing; it also takes advantage of an existing algorithm by trying it out under different conditions. This demonstrates the flexibility and emergent properties of these algorithms. On the other hand, as the authors note, the results are not always exciting:Artificial intelligence can also be used to catalog and automate tedious tasks. Archaeologists find thousands of fragments of pottery (especially Roman) and it is tedious work to analyze thousands of fragments of vases, amphorae, and plates. On the other hand, all these fragments once cataloged and studied the relationships between them, can provide valuable information on the daily life of past civilizations. In Cambridge, they have developed an algorithm that matches the fragment with the pottery profile in a database. This approach makes it possible to quickly catalog, and then with other algorithms study, the distribution of the various types of ceramics in an archaeological site.This approach is not limited to Roman ceramics. Researchers at the University of Arizona have used a similar approach to classify the designs and patterns of ancient Pueblo ceramics.Archaeologists often find epigraphs, but these inscriptions are often damaged over the centuries and rendered illegible. Recently, DeepMind presented Ithaca (a follow-up of the previous model called Pythia), an artificial intelligence model capable of finding missing characters in a text that has been damaged. The authors of DeepMind trained their model on one of the largest corpora of Greek inscriptions to obtain results similar to those obtained by human epigraphers. Similar approaches have also been attempted with other languages such as the Scythian language, 3000-year-old Chinese oracle bone scripts, and Persian cuneiform tablets.Although it is not easy to decipher ancient inscriptions when the language is known (Greek, Latin, and so on), there are cases when the language is lost. Languages can be grouped into different families according to the traits they share (alphabets, vocabulary, grammar, sounds, and so on). Often languages share a common root ( e.g., Neo-Latin languages, “aquam” in Latin, “acqua” in Italian, “agua” in Spanish) and then undergo an evolutionary path that causes them to diverge. These principles have been used by linguists, to look for similarities and common patterns in order to decipher dead languages.AI has been shown to be capable of finding patterns and finding similarities. Therefore, this approach has been attempted to try to decode lost languages such as Ugaritic or Linear B. In this case, the authors used a model based on LSTM and embedding and obtained some interesting results. The approach used, does nothing more than look for spans in the lost texts with known tokens.Recent years have seen a large effort to digitize art. Major museums (such as the MET)have created large databases of paintings, books, statues, objects, artifacts, and so on. Often these huge digital libraries are accessible to the public and scholars free of charge. The institutions themselves are moving towards coordinated initiatives. For instance, the European Union has created guidelines to digitize the immense cultural heritage.These initiatives are aimed at democratizing access to collections and cultural heritage. Indeed, many works preserved in museums can be seen by the public simply by visiting the sites. Moreover, museums only display a small part of their collections (many works are stored in warehouses and are never exhibited except in rare exhibitions) so these initiatives allow access to works that normally could not be seen. On the one hand, these initiatives allow valuable resources for scholars who want to study the works. On the other hand, algorithms need data and this allows increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence models to be trained.As we have seen, works, however, preserved in a museum, are delicate objects and can be lost at any time. Safeguarding them is an important and difficult job, whether it is to preserve them or restore them. In these tasks, artificial intelligence can help (monitoring, studying them, and so on). On the other hand, technology needs to be backed by policies and investments to preserve heritage.Not least, AI has developed at great speed in recent years and interesting perspectives open up for the increasingly powerful models. In fact, as we have seen many of the models used are convolutional networks that have proven to be efficient for tasks involving images. However, all other areas of machine learning can be used as well. In fact, for example, unsupervised clustering can be used to group ceramic fragments.In addition, the first models that were used to reconstruct inscriptions and translate dead languages were based on encoder-decoders and LSTMs. Pythia also used the same architecture, but already the later DeepMind Ithaca article was based on a transformer-like architecture. As vision transformers are shown to be effective for imaging we can expect more similar models in the coming years.Another note is how it is not necessarily necessary to develop new and sophisticated algorithms for new tasks: as we have seen some researchers have leveraged DALL-E which is publicly accessible via a website. This shows that many of the available algorithms could be repurposed in the future.Aside from technical demonstrations of AI capabilities, it opens up real perspectives and impact. For example, having a good digital image is the first step in restoring a painting or mosaic. Also, many archaeological sites are understaffed and surveillance is expensive and problematic. Not to mention that AI will be able to help make decisions, prioritize interventions, and reduce costs.Open ethical questions certainly remain. The result as seen with the mosaics should be taken carefully. After all, the model sometimes more than reconstructing history seems to be rewriting it. As in the case of Rembrandt's painting, the algorithm tries to guess based on the data at its disposal, and in fact, the curators of the exhibition pointed out the separation between the original part and what has been reconstructed.In addition, satellite imagery and LIDAR technology have identified thousands of new archaeological sites not yet explored. These may be excavated by grave robbers long before archaeologists can work on them. As important as it is to consider publishing the data, one must also move cautiously.Another thorny case is restorations. Since the 19th century, every new technology has been exploited in restoration without considering the possible damage. For example, concrete has burdened structures causing sometimes more damage than expected.You can look for my other articles, you can also subscribe to get notified when I publish articles, and you can also connect or reach me on LinkedIn.

Why Climate Change is Solvable,Palmer Owyoung,Nov 4,https://medium.com/greener-together/why-climate-change-is-solvable-3351e73e9cfe?source=home---------48------------------0----------,"Amidst record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires, a global pandemic, floods, hurricanes, and ice caps melting at an accelerated pace it is easy to get caught up in the wave of doom-porn surrounding climate change that seems to be sweeping the Internet these days.I recently read an article entitled “Want to Stop Climate Change? Get a New Job!” in which the author argues that none of the current solutions including degrowth, carbon taxes, minimalism, veganism, and population reduction, among others will work because they require people to choose against their desires and they require leaders to rise above the system to make changes that are good for the planet.The author argues that the only way to solve climate change is for all of us to get new jobs that create renewable energy, otherwise, we are all part of the problem.Others take a more fatalistic point of view. For example in an article for the New Yorker, author Jonathan Franzen said “We literally are living in end times for civilization as we know it… We are long past the point of averting climate catastrophe.”So is all of this doom and gloom warranted? Yes, we are facing some extreme challenges and things are likely to get worse before they get better, but are we as Franzen says “Living in the end of times?”In this article, I argue that climate doomism is overly simplistic, unscientific, and based on suppositions, not facts or data. It also shows a lack of understanding of the complexity of climate change and a lack of acknowledgment of the solutions being implemented and the changes that are occurring.According to Michael E. Mann, arguably the most prominent climate scientist on the planet, “If the science objectively demonstrated it was too late to limit warming below catastrophic levels, that would be one thing and we scientists would be faithful to that. But science doesn’t say that.”Climate doomisim is just as bad as denialism as it leads to inaction. After all, what’s the point in eating less meat, flying less, or taking public transport if our demise is imminent? We might as well throw a giant house party in one last hurrah if we are going the way of the dodo bird anyway.While I am not saying that extinction isn’t a possibility, if we do nothing, the likelihood goes from a possibility to an inevitability if we sit around saying “we’re all doomed.” Subscribing to this fatalistic view also leads to anxiety, and an anxious mind has a harder time solving problems.Climate doom doesn’t make you smart, it doesn’t make you cool, it makes you an even bigger part of the problem. Because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Henry Ford famously said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t you’re right.” If you spend enough time with a climate doomer, their attitude will infect you as well, this is known as emotional contagion, and left unchecked it can spread like a virus, and lead to climate apathy.Reducing meat consumption, population reduction, carbon taxes, minimalism, and degrowth are not meant to be stand-alone solutions to climate change. Rather they are meant to be contributing factors to solving a very big and complex puzzle. Implementing them will buy us time until new technology, changes in social norms, and a better understanding of how nature works can offer us more complete solutions.For example, studies show that If everyone went vegan, only a quarter of current farmland would be needed. However, it is unrealistic to expect the whole world to quit eating meat, so what if we just reduced our consumption of meat and cheese?Skipping a steak just once a week with your family would reduce emissions equivalent to taking your car off the road for nearly three months. If the entire U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week: We’d reduce emissions equivalent to not driving 91 billion miles — the same as taking 7.6 million cars off the road.What if we didn’t give up all meat but just the worst culprits like beef and lamb? According to a study by the World Resources Institute, this would lead to a per capita food and land use-related greenhouse gas emissions reduction of between 15 and 35 percent by 2050. Going vegetarian could reduce those per capita emissions by half. It would also reduce deforestation while supporting biodiversity, which would have a synergistic effect.The point is that we don’t have to solve climate change all at once. We need to slow it down to give technology and society enough time to evolve. Solving climate change will not be an event, it will be a process that takes place over decades and some of the solutions that are being proposed today will age out, as nascent technologies mature to take their place.For example, if we cut down on our meat consumption now, by 2035 it’s projected that “alternative meats,” which include cell and plant-based meats, will be a $290 billion industry making up to 22% of the market share. If we put a sin tax on industrially grown meat to make producers pay for their negative externalities, this would speed up the mass adoption of alternative meats even more, allowing people to have their steak and eat it too, so to speak.In a new report, experts from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and sustainability-focused investing group Blue Horizon show that creating alternative proteins reduced emissions the most per dollar spent. Plant-based proteins were three times more cost-effective than sustainable cement and nearly 15 times more efficient than green power. The researchers called alternative proteins “one of the low-hanging fruit in the fight against climate change.”Some might say that people won’t cut down on meat and dairy, but the data says otherwise.A 2018 survey from Johns Hopkins claims that two-thirds of Americans are already cutting down on their meat consumption. A 2021 survey shows that more than 47% of Americans see themselves as flexitarians who are trying to eat a more plant-based diet and it’s even higher (54%) in those aged 18–39.The same thing is happening in Europe where almost one-third no longer consider themselves to be full-time meat-eaters and it’s projected that 25% of the UK population will be vegan or vegetarian by 2025.Coincidentally studies show that it takes just 25% of a population for a social movement to reach a tipping point to establish a new norm. The researchers point to recent legal and societal shifts in workplace sexual harassment, gay marriage, gun laws, racism, and gender equality as evidence that social norms do change.A 2021 survey from the Pew Research Center shows that 80% of people are willing to make changes to how they work and live to reduce the effects of global climate change, which means we are already well past this tipping point and the evidence is showing that behaviors are starting to change.For example, net emissions have been dropping in most developed economies including some of the largest CO2 emitters such as the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom, where total emissions have been falling since 2005. In high-income countries the overall fall has been about 18%, in the US it was 18.4% but the UK has seen an almost 45% drop.These drops have occurred without aggressive climate policies. Rather they have come mainly from improved technology which has led to greater energy efficiency and a shift away from coal-fired electricity generation to natural gas and renewables. Just think about how much quicker this can happen if our leaders and communities took a more aggressive approach to climate activism.Another important tipping point we have surpassed is for mass adoption of EVs, wind, solar and batteries. History shows us that for a disruptive technology to become mainstream it takes between 3–5% of the market share to be accepted. This has been true for the adoption of cars, mobile phones, and electric lighting among other things.The data shows us that the US, China, and Europe have all surpassed the 5% threshold for EVs. In 2021 wind and solar made up 10% of global energy, which also puts us far past the tipping point. With solar growing by 23% over the year before and wind growing by 14%.Part of the reason for the increase is because of the massive decline in the cost of producing solar panels, which has become the most inexpensive form of electricity in history, as of 2020. Just ten years ago, this was thought impossible and even the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast just a quarter of the amount of solar energy that was installed in 2020. The reason for this failed prediction was that the organization didn’t take into account the greater sums of investment, which led to increases in efficiency and a precipitous drop in prices.The common argument doomers like to make against EVs and renewable energy is that rare earth minerals have to be mined, and solar panels and wind turbines aren’t recyclable, which means that we are just transferring pollution from the air to the ground.While this is true, again it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how technology works, as well as a lack of imagination. For example, biomining is a way to extract minerals using plants (phytomining) and/or microbes. You see rare-earth minerals are not all that rare. It’s just that they occur in such small amounts in rock and soil that we need to resort to blowing up mountains and drilling underground to extract them. But if plants and microbes, which don’t make salary demands, can do it, then it makes these minerals much more accessible. This technology exists today, it just needs to be scaled.Then there is the fact that in August of 2022, a company announced the first recyclable wind turbine, whose resin can be turned into (strangely enough) gummy bears and other products. Solar panels are already 80% recyclable, it’s just that the current technology makes it labor-intensive and expensive to do. However, since solar panels last 25 to 50 years that gives us a lot of time to innovate to make them more efficient.Again, we don’t have to solve climate change all at one go, we just need to buy ourselves some time until science and technology evolve enough so that we can reduce or eliminate our emissions and pollution.The speed at which technology improves is something else that many climate doomers fail to understand. Because of Moore’s Law, we are seeing improvements in synthetic biology (think bio-mining and cell-based meats), material science AI, and energy at increasingly faster rates.Add to this record amounts of capital being invested into mitigating climate change, which has grown by 210% to $87.5 billion, invested into 3000 climate tech startups, between 2020 to 2021, according to the consultancy PWC.This has led to improved efficiency in solar panels, which are at 25% up from 20% just a few years ago; carbon neutral jet fuel; carbon neutral concrete; and growable buildings from mycelium.Exponential technology will eventually lead us to nuclear fusion, which could meet the global demand for clean free energy. However, the joke amongst physicists is that fusion is always 30 years away. This time experts agree that it really is just 20 to 30 years away.There are two reasons for this belief. The first is that in December 2021 for the first time in history scientists created a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used, a huge milestone. The second reason is that by 2025 ITER, (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) will come online. Located in the south of France, it will be the largest fusion reactor ever built and is a collaboration between 35 countries at an estimated cost of 22 billion Euros.Exponential technology has also given us a better understanding of nature. More data has shown us the importance of maintaining a healthy microbiome in the soil to prevent droughts and improve the nutrients in our food. We now understand the role mangroves play in preventing floods, keeping the oceans clean, and sequestering carbon. We now know that whales absorb huge amounts of CO2 in their bodies, and their poo acts as fertilizer for plankton, which has absorbed 40% of the CO2 ever produced. Just increasing plankton production by 1% is the equivalent of planting 2 billion trees.While there are still plenty of challenges left, the good news is that according to a review published in the journal Nature, global fishing is becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In some places like Tampa Bay, Florida, and the Philippines, the habitats are being restored. According to the review, the ocean can repair itself and scientists estimate that with enough effort the oceans can fully recover by 2050, in just one generation.Even the Great Barrier Reef which has seen substantial damage from mass bleaching events and crown of thorns starfish has reported some good news. Between August 2021 and May 2022, a survey of 87 reefs found that the average hard coral cover in the upper region and central areas of the reef increased by around one-third, the highest amount of coral cover since the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) began monitoring 36 years ago.Although this doesn’t mean we are out of the woods yet, it does mean that coral reefs are capable of repairing themselves and if we assist them with a little help from science they can do so even quicker.Despite record-breaking fires, droughts, and disease even our forests are not beyond saving. However, while planting trees as a means to stop climate change has been in the news a lot, the latest science counsels against this in favor of a more natural approach called rewilding. This natural method of regrowing trees is also faster and makes more biodiverse healthier forests. Since it is also cheaper and less labor intensive, it is a much more scalable solution than planting.However, technology is only part of the solution, and there are a lot of developments that doomers fail to acknowledge. For example in August 2022 a $370 billion climate bill passed, making it the single largest American investment to slow global warming by reducing demand for fossil fuels.The bill invests money over 10 years in the form of tax credits that steer consumers toward electric vehicles and push utility companies toward renewable energy sources. Energy experts say that the bill could help to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 2005 levels, which puts the country in striking distance of meeting its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030.On July 28, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly declared the ability to live in “a clean, healthy and sustainable environment,” a universal human right. Although the declaration is not legally binding, resolutions like this have in the past served as a foundation for effective treaties and national laws.Shortly after the UN declaration, several citizens from Germany sued their own government. The plaintiffs, some of which are filing on behalf of their children, claim the right to breathe clean air is a human right that should be upheld by their government.In fact, since 2015, over 1,000 climate-related court cases have been brought by citizens against their governments and corporations around the world to fight for a cleaner planet.These lawsuits are gaining traction. For example on May 26, 2021, a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030 from the 2019 levels. That includes emissions from vehicles that burn Shell’s gasoline.The same day the Dutch court ruled on Shell’s case Exxon shareholders, along with the world’s largest investment fund manager, Blackrock, voted to oust three board members to replace them with experts in renewable energy and climate science.In 2012 Unity College in Maine became the first university to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. By 2015, fossil fuel divestment became the fastest-growing divestment movement in history and by October 2021, 1,485 institutions totaling $39.2 trillion in assets committed to or had already divested from the fossil fuel industry.Several major cities including San Francisco, New York, Boston, London, Mexico City, Barcelona, Madrid, Oslo, Brussels, Copenhagen, Paris, Milan, Athens, and Rome were already restricting cars in the central business districts to fight climate change and make the areas more livable, pre-COVID-19. The pandemic has accelerated this trend and has highlighted our basic human need to have open outdoor spaces.The ban on cars has resulted in cleaner air, reduced pedestrian deaths, lower obesity rates, fewer stress-related diseases, and additional space for housing, parks, trees, plants biking, and walking paths. Furthermore, business has improved, in the areas where the streets are closed. For example, London saw an increase in retail spending of 30% at shops and restaurants. Studies show that walkable streets are more economically productive per acre and property values thrive.Other major cities like Paris, Madrid, Ottawa, Seattle, and Melbourne are turning their densely packed downtown areas into so-called 15-minute cities in which cars are banned or limited and all essential services are strategically placed within walking or biking distance.A recent report from the Center for London shows that reduced traffic neighborhoods are one of the easiest ways to save money, improve health and make cities quieter.In over a dozen cities and counties throughout the United States and Canada, including Bakersfield, Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, Monterey County, Mendocino County, Grand Forks (North Dakota), and Fort Worth as well as several communities in Hawaii, have taken a similar approach by implementing Blue Zones Project. This redesigns cities to make them more livable, by adding bike paths, improving and adding parks, and trees, encouraging more plant-based eating, creating greater opportunities for community engagement, and making them more pedestrian-friendly.The results? A 14% reduction in obesity, a 30% reduction in smoking, lower healthcare costs, less employee absenteeism, and, a generally happier community. So, reducing car usage not only has environmental benefits, but economic and health benefits as well.Climate doomism is as damaging as climate denialism because it promotes inaction and is counterproductive. There is nothing in the scientific literature that says climate change is an intractable problem, provided that we work towards solutions, rather than shrugging our shoulders with a defeatist attitude.Fear promotes anxiety, which leads to inaction. If you want to do something to fight climate change then educate yourself about solutions and elevate the consciousness of the people around you.Remember it takes just 25% of a population to hit the tipping point for a social movement to become a societal norm. The interesting thing about the study is that in experiment after experiment if they were just 1% below that 25% mark, the movement failed. Because we are connected through emotional contagion if you are a climate doomer, you are affecting the people around you. So, the question you have to ask yourself is, do you want to be part of the problem or do you want to be part of the solution?For some ideas on how you can be part of the solution please read The Most Important Thing You Can Do to Fight Climate Change and 10 Ways to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint."
The “Sunk Benefit” Fallacy,Yonatan Zunger,Nov 3,https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/the-sunk-benefit-fallacy-c7adb6eda761?source=home---------54------------------0----------,"When is the right time to quit and move on to something else? Setting aside the obvious practical issues like whether we can quit a thing, I’ve often seen people — especially very principled and diligent people — fall prey to a hidden obstacle that I call the “sunk benefit” fallacy.You’ve probably heard of the “sunk cost” fallacy, in which people are reluctant to give up on something because they’ve already put so much effort into it, regardless of the real question — would the amount of further effort required be justified by the outcome? There, the trick is to ignore “sunk costs” — costs you’ve already paid and which therefore come out the same on both sides of the ledger.Sunk benefits are similar, but they’re about the wins you’ve already had.When you work on a project with people and successfully solve a problem, you (rightly) feel proud and accomplished. If the project helped create some “thing,” from a tool to a company, that will require further maintenance and attention, you’ll probably come to love (and hate) that system as you know its idiosyncrasies and nuances.This can lead to two different feelings of “loyalty” on your part: to the team, and to the system. Both of these can make it feel wrong to abandon the project —but while the first is real, the second is actually an illusion.When you successfully solved a problem with your system, you created some value in the world — and nothing can reach back from the future and take that away from you. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll solve future problems in the same way, or with the same tools, or even with the same people.The things you and your team built were means to an end — the end being the problem you solved. When you come to a future problem, you might reuse ideas, or some parts, but you wouldn’t hesitate to replace a part of the system you built with a better one you come up with later. In the same way, you shouldn’t hesitate to abandon the system altogether and move to a new one if that’s the appropriate choice.And there’s the rub: the system, be it a single tool or a company you’ve worked at, is just a means, never an end. It was useful in the past, but that doesn’t mean you need to continue to use it in the future whether it’s appropriate or not. That value is a “sunk benefit.”Value the work you have done and move on to the next task, always keeping in mind your greater goal of improving the world. Be in love with and excited about the problems you have solved and will solve, not the specific tools with which you do so.Contrast this with the other loyalty we talked about, to the people you worked with. This is different because people are ends, not means. It is right, and good, and healthy for you to want them to succeed and thrive going forward. Invest, therefore, in helping them as people, and in your relationships with them.But don’t feel a microsecond’s guilt over abandoning a system, or even a company, any more than you would about replacing a code library you wrote a few years ago. It served its purpose then and perhaps a different tool is needed now. The benefit is sunk, and there’s no mystical ledger out there in which you will be rewarded for sticking with a system, a tool, or a company.Rather raise a glass to celebrate the things you have done; to grieve for the things you wanted to do; and to look forward to the things that you shall do, wherever that challenge may take you."
Leaving San Francisco,Nicholas Moryl,Nov 23,https://nmoryl.com/leaving-san-francisco-2bf3663072cd?source=home---------9------------------0----------,"When I first landed in the Bay Area my taxi driver got lost.It was July 2011. I had just stepped off a 13-hour flight from London, where I had spent the past 2 years. (Technically the flight was from Stockholm where I had been visiting friends for a long weekend, but regardless — )I wasn’t going far — just to Menlo Park, where I was to be staying on a friend’s sofa — but this was before you could assume everyone had a magic box in their pocket that could solve more or less any problem in a few taps. 6 weeks before, when I had been staying with the same friend while interviewing for a new job, I had to get a GPS with my rental car to find my way around. It was a strange, liminal time. Everyone could feel that the world had fundamentally changed but the oncoming wave of mobile technology was still primitive and limited, an often frustrating glimmer of its full potential.Eventually I navigated to El Camino Real and from there down to the vicinity of the Stanford campus.I was staying with my friend Brian. Back then he was a Ph.D student at Stanford, but in college we had been roommates. We both came from the midwest and played percussion in some of the university’s various ensembles so we’d grown close. Despite the fact I had spent the four years between college and my stint on his couch hopping between New York, DC, and London in various finance jobs while he headed straight west for his doctoral studies, we were able to pick up more or less where we left off. We played foosball in his living room, obsessed over Farmville (I was interviewing at a couple of mobile gaming companies), and talked about relationships and where our lives were going until the small hours. The normal, somewhat banal mid-20-something navel-gazing.And so moving to the Bay Area in 2011 was easy. Social networking was still novel enough that I could simply search Facebook for people I knew in San Francisco, message them, and get a lot of enthusiastic responses. People weren’t yet jaded about being perpetually online. In fact, that’s how I found my first roommate — a friend of a friend who would go on to co-found Instacart. This was the era of the Facebook Effect, when the larger narrative around these platforms was one of their ability to foster positive change and connect people. The notion that they could channel our cruelest impulses, addict us, and grow into a modern panopticon was not yet what people discussed at dinner parties.The Bay, the epicenter of everything tech, had a special kind of giddy energy. It was far different from the cities I had recently left behind: New York, Washington D.C., and London. San Francisco was friendly, encouraging, “yes and” — seemingly everyone I met earnestly thought they were changing the world for the better. And when they weren’t, they were rock climbing, playing in bands, performing stand-up comedy, making art, dancing on the beach until sunrise, and willing their wildest dreams into existence. The Bay was the home of the Black Panthers, the Hell’s Angels, Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters, The Whole Earth Catalog, and all the descendants of that family tree. You can more or less draw a straight line from the end of World War II through the biker gangs, the hipsters, the civil rights movements, and the hippies straight to Apple Computer, Burning Man, and Google. It wasn’t just that people in the Bay believed they could change the world: they knew they could. All the proof they needed was all around them.Last Thursday I loaded most of my possessions onto a truck. After eleven and a half years, I’m leaving San Francisco — for now.What changed? Is it not still true that the Bay is home to the hackers and misfits who are dreaming up and building a better future?I could cynically weave a narrative about how, in the last decade, the underdogs went mainstream. The pirates became the navy. Startups became The Man. How now every newly-minted MBA rushes out to Silicon Valley with a business plan in hand to build the next “Uber for X” squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of a yet-to-be-digitized industry and that entrepreneurship is just another career ladder. How the real rebels have moved on to weirder pastures and geography is no longer relevant: we all live in the metaverse already, and those who understand that are the ones living in the future, poised to build the next big thing.I could bemoan the sclerotic San Francisco government and its inability to solve basic problems despite vast resources: homelessness, housing costs, property crime, and quality of life concerns. People earnestly debate the role of racial and class equity in preventing public transit fare-jumping, prosecuting individuals shoplifting or selling stolen goods, and open-air drug dealing and consumption. Both sides feel righteous in their anger. The basic social contract is visibly fraying. These things matter.I could note the dissonance between how small teams can build world-changing products and the Bay Area’s collective lack of political will to allow for change. How the region’s politics are dominated by attachment to ideas about the way things should be rather than acceptance of the way things are. How our fixation on aesthetic ideals about how the world should work — from housing to transportation to opening a business — beggars the vast human potential both already living in the Bay Area and that wants to move here. (Despite bad governance, the Bay Area is still growing faster than anywhere else in the country.) How this all amounts to a massive failure of imagination, of aspiration, and of belief in humanity’s potential.Those are all stories I could tell about my relationship to the Bay Area — and none of them are relevant.When I moved here I was 25 years old. I’m now 37.If I was the same person at 37 that I was at 25, I’d be disappointed in myself. I’ve experienced so much and those experiences have changed me.Relationships are the story of overlap. When you meet someone — a friend or a partner — or when you take a job, move to a city, or pick up a hobby, it’s an action that reflects an alignment of circumstances in your life. It’s the right time for that connection to happen. And yet you and whoever (or whatever) you’re in relationship with are both changing all the time in ways both big and small. Those changes accumulate and eventually you might wake up and realize you’re not the same person. That old sweater no longer fits you — maybe not literally, but it no longer feels right. That friendship takes more effort and each time you hang out interactions feel a little more stilted and forced. It’s time to let it go.If you continue to hold onto it there’s a gnawing friction — maybe guilt, maybe grief, maybe just a feeling of nagging discomfort — because you’re out of alignment. You’re acting out of habit. You’re refusing to accept the change that is happening. Change will happen regardless of your attempts to stop or control it. You’re choosing to remain stuck — and choosing not to be open to new things that will enter your life if you let old things go.There is no judgment in changing or letting go. There is no fault or blame. There is no good or bad. It’s just acceptance of what is. It’s the failure to accept change that leads to suffering.Since moving to the Bay I’ve gotten married and divorced. I’ve raised a puppy. I’ve had a half dozen jobs. Friends have come and gone. Some friends have passed before their time, by their own choice or not. Some have had kids. Others have had cancer. A few have had both.I’ve survived a global pandemic. I’ve picked up new hobbies and let others go. My body has transformed: I’ve trained it, injured it, modified it, and healed it.I’ve built and raced several cars, ridden a motorcycle to Burning Man, danced until dawn at underground raves, and sang at the top of my lungs, soaked in sweat seeing my favorite bands perform. I’ve worked out so hard I had trouble stringing together coherent sentences. I’ve made art, played music, watched a meteor shower on a mountaintop with someone I loved, road tripped through the desert, encountered anteaters in the central American jungle, and swam naked in the moonlight in Puerto Rico.I’ve had my heart broken so badly I thought I’d never feel happiness again. I’ve gone to therapy, stopped going to therapy, started going to therapy again, and started doing psychedelic-assisted therapy.All of this has been possible because of the life I created in San Francisco. Had I not moved here over a decade ago many of those things would not have happened. (Naturally, another set of things would have taken their place; yet I do not grieve for not having experienced them.) San Francisco made so much available to me, things that were unique to being here in this decade of my life and at this moment in time, and I gave so much back to it. San Francisco changed my life, and for that I will always be grateful.And yet that does not create an obligation. As my former wife once told me, a relationship is not a death pact. Or, in the words we would both use now: attachment is the root of suffering. Choosing to stay in this city — remaining attached to the life I created here — would be denying change, choosing to foster the conditions for my own unhappiness, creating my own suffering. Living here, in the life I have created with its habits and patterns and quirks and opportunities, is no longer right for who I am. So I am releasing myself from it.I am not blaming the city. I think we do ourselves a disservice by placing agency for our actions outside of ourselves. Our paths converged, intertwined, and are now diverging. It’s okay. Life goes on, just in different directions.Nothing is permanent: those paths might yet intersect later, as Brian and I found out many years ago. By letting go, I am allowing for my own change, growth, and flourishing. Maybe I’ll return, and if I do it will be as a better, more fully-realized version of myself; and it will be because I am once again able to wholeheartedly commit to, celebrate, and contribute to this city’s unique vibrancy. Letting go is sometimes necessary for growth. It is an act of love both for ourselves and for those with whom we are in relation.Sometimes love is not grinding it out, forcing yourself to continue down a specific path, grasping tightly to what you “should” do. Sometimes love is allowing for space so that each of you has room to blossom in the way you need. Sometimes love is thanking your partner and letting go.So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Now it ends as it began: staying at a friend’s place, balanced on that golden thread between what is and what might be, holding it all lightly."

Why Everything Looks the Same,Ryan Duffy,Oct 23,https://medium.com/knowable/why-everything-looks-the-same-bad80133dd6e?source=home---------105------------------0----------,"Do you ever get the feeling that everything around you looks the same?Across every consumer category, variety and originality have given way to monotony and conformity.A triple threat of economic globalization, generational transition, and new technology has flattened the aesthetics of our digital and physical lives.What are the origins of these regressive trends? Why do they matter? And what can founders, marketers, and creators do to stand out amid a sea of sameness?In his 2016 story for The Verge titled “Welcome to Airspace: How Silicon Valley helps spread the same sterile aesthetic across the world,” Kyle Chayka revealed the banal consequences of Airbnb’s rapid rise. Playing on the company’s name, he called the phenomenon AirSpace:The 2007 introduction of the iPhone opened the door to the social web, transforming our digital lives. By the time Chayka wrote his story in 2016, those technologies were reshaping our physical spaces, too — at global scale.When Airbnb launched in 2008, it sold itself as a new way to travel, allowing users to experience cities how locals do. It was about human connection and authenticity. But it wasn’t long before a creeping sameness set in:From Brooklyn to Mexico City to Tokyo, interior spaces became interchangeable. As Chakya wrote:Ironically, Airbnb’s original promise of a differentiated travel experience was neutered by the defining qualities of the hotel industry it aimed to disrupt:The social web smoothed the rough edges of taste, substituting idiosyncratic local charm for blank placelessness — a bellwether for a broader trend to come.Chayka’s articulation of AirSpace was prescient, but the term never quite caught on.A different one did: Blanding.Blanding is the copy-paste model of consumer product development and brand marketing that follows repetitive patterns in the name of modernity but at the expense of authenticity and originality.The last decade saw an explosion of new direct-to-consumer brands gain mindshare and wallet share, especially among the millennial set. Think Casper mattresses, Away luggage, and Warby Parker eyewear.Fueled by the internet’s democratization of ad targeting, a newly-employed generation of young people with disposable income, and a steady flow of venture capital investment, a class of insurgent startups barged its way into markets previously dominated by a small group of legacy corporations.But their disruption quickly gave way to the sanitized agreeableness of blanding.As Ben Schott wrote in Bloomberg Opinion:Chasing the same valuable millennial demo, many direct-to-consumer brands followed a turnkey pattern:They abided by the same aesthetic conventions:Even their names were paint-by-numbers:These prefabricated brand signifiers combined to give us what we now know as the “millennial aesthetic,” a blueprint designed to entice Instagram-obsessed young people.Alas, the millennial aesthetic that defined the past decade is showing its age. Some are even declaring it officially “over.” Or worse: cheugy.But blanding isn’t dead. It’s just evolving. And Gen Z is setting the template for blanding 2.0, an explicit rejection of the previous generation’s conventions but familiar nonetheless.The more things change, the more they stay the same.The scourge of blanding isn’t limited to Airbnbs and direct-to-consumer products. You can find examples across every consumer category.Seemingly all at once, the world’s biggest luxury fashion brands replaced their charmingly unique logos with nearly identical semi-bold, sans-serif, all-caps wordmarks. Squint, and you can hardly tell the difference.A 2021 Road & Track article titled “Why does every new car look like every other new car?” compares the form factors of midsize SUVs from 24 manufacturers. Despite a wide range of price points, they’re more alike than they are different:Website design, especially for SaaS companies, is depressingly mundane:Or just take a look at the landing pages of these four subscription media products — slightly different conventions than SaaS products but indistinguishable nonetheless.This suppression of creativity in web design has even been confirmed by science.When you’re endlessly scrolling DoorDash or UberEats, do you ever get a feeling of déjà vu?On-demand food delivery has given rise to ghost kitchens and virtual restaurants. Digital-native restaurateurs can now use the same chefs, facilities, ingredients, and packaging to fulfill orders for multiple “restaurants” simultaneously. So whether tonight’s dinner comes from Wings and Things, Wings Plus, or Hot Wings Cafe, you’re getting the same food, in the same container, from the same kitchen.In 2013, Netflix’s Ted Sarandos famously told GQ:“The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.”When it launched its streaming service, Netflix offered two key value propositions that differentiated it from every other market player:Its aversion to ads was baked into the culture from square one. As CEO Reed Hastings said in a 2019 earnings call:Never say never.Facing increased competition from new streaming players like HBOMax, Netflix is abandoning its two core tenets by introducing an ad-supported tier and reportedly considering a traditional weekly release schedule for some of its shows.So, yes, Netflix is becoming like HBO — just not in the ways Sarandos probably imagined back in 2013.The world’s biggest social media apps are becoming more alike than different — often by brazenly copying the competition’s features. Meta’s Instagram is the prime culprit:But Meta isn’t the only guilty party:These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. The lines between social apps will continue to blur long into the future.Blanding has infected nearly every aspect of the modern consumer experience. And it’s not by chance that its rise parallels social media’s.Algorithms haven’t just reshaped the way we consume content. They’ve insidiously retrained us to want the same things, flattening taste and desire like pancakes. As Chayka wrote:It’s also no coincidence that the “disruptive” companies most responsible for the creep of global monotony are funded by a relatively small cohort of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. VCs are known for “pattern matching,” a method of reasoning by analogy when evaluating early-stage companies for investment. With few measurable criteria upon which to judge a startup, they instead look for familiar patterns from the market or their own experiences as indicators of potential success. Unfortunately, this methodology results in an extreme lack of diversity across the industry. Venture-backed founders are disproportionately similar demographically:When the capital that drives innovation comes from and goes to a homogenous population with a relatively narrow shared worldview, it should come as no surprise that its outputs are so alike.There are functional, industry-specific factors that impose uniformity, too:Two recent products demonstrate the competitive advantage of resistance to blanding.Until recently, the grocery store bottled water aisle was dominated by indistinguishable brands. Clear plastic bottles, soft blues, and images of mountains and streams as far as the eye could see.Enter Liquid Death: a brand that zigs hard against the category’s tired zags. Death metal-inspired graphic design. Hyper-aggressive copywriting. And aluminum tallboy packaging that begs for a brown paper bag.It’s undeniably and unapologetically different. It’s also one of the fastest-growing non-alcoholic beverage brands in recent history, achieving a $700m valuation in less than five years.Although it doesn’t go into production until 2023, the Tesla Cybertruck is one of the most talked-about vehicles in the world today. That’s thanks to a form factor unlike anything the market has ever seen. Its designers abandoned every conceivable convention to build something entirely new. Halo’s Master Chief would be proud.Time will tell if the final product lives up to the hype, but with more than one million units reportedly pre-ordered (5x more than Tesla’s Model 3), it’s already a serious contender.Of course, there’s a business case for following proven formulas:These are conventional wisdoms, not universal truths.And some rules are made to be broken.Real-time paradigm shifts like no-code, cloud computing, drop shipping, AI, and remote work are democratizing entrepreneurship in unprecedented ways.Long protected by gatekeepers, the means of production, promotion, and distribution are now freely available to anyone with a laptop.Today, one person with no business or product experience can do what would have taken a team of highly-trained people just a few years ago — in less time, for a fraction of the cost.That means more crowded markets, more intense competition, and more value placed on uniqueness, or what VCs call “alpha.” Adamant Ventures founder Jason Yeh defines alpha as:Submission to blanding’s gravitational pull signals to the market and investors that a business lacks the competitive edge needed to win.In business, it rarely makes sense to reinvent the wheel completely.But now more than ever, identifying your points of differentiation — your alpha — is critical.For more insights like these, get the Knowable app and join 40,000+ founders, creators, and everyday go-getters building new skills and fueling their ambitions with audio lessons on business, startups, self-improvement, and more from the world’s smartest people.

Why are there so many Web3 startups?,Eric Feng,Dec 4,https://efeng.medium.com/why-are-there-so-many-web3-startups-43a150379d52?source=home---------7------------------0----------,"This week, Pitchbook published their latest Emerging Tech Indicator (ETI) report which tracks early stage investment activity amongst the world’s most successful venture capital firms to “gauge which areas of tech are grabbing VCs’ attention”. In Q3, the sector that received the largest amount of VC dollars according to the ETI report was Web3 with nearly $900 million. That’s more than fintech, biotech, security, ecommerce, gaming, and dozens of other mainstream industries.And Q3 wasn’t the first time that Web3 topped the ETI report. In fact, Web3 has led the ETI rankings for 5 consecutive quarters now. Over the past 12 months, there has been over $6.5 billion of ETI capital invested into Web3, which is more than double that of the next highest category of fintech at $2.7 billion.Even with all the ongoing challenges across cryptocurrency, which has seen its combined market capitalization decline by 2/3 since last November, investment interest in the sector remains stronger than other industries. Why? Because entrepreneurs still want to start Web3 companies.Building a good Web3 startup is hard. Explaining what makes a startup Web3 in the first place is even harder. Here are a few attempts. Leading Web3 investor A16Z describes Web3 as “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens”. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3, describes it as “an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are purely algorithmic things hosted by everybody”. Web3 has also been called “the hyperfinancialization of all human existence” and where “every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity”. Pretty confusing right?Here’s a simpler definition: a Web3 startup interacts with data stored on a blockchain. That’s it. Read from Ethereum via an RPC provider? You’re a Web3 company. Send a transaction on the Solana network? Web3. Implement a Connect Wallet button on your website? Same. Blockchains, the public shared ledgers of information, are the data building blocks of Web3, and if you use any of this data in your product, then you’re part of Web3 too.Now why is this interesting to entrepreneurs? Because we haven’t had free access to data in a long time.All consumer products need data. If you’re building a restaurant discovery website, you need reviews. If you’re building a shopping app, you need a product catalog. If you’re building a photo or music or video sharing service, you need (obviously) photos or music or videos. Sure you can get users to create that data for you — after all, users authoring data is the core tenet of Web2. But it takes a lot of users to create a useful amount of data, and until then the product experience for those few initial users will be incomplete or simply bad, which is then an impediment to acquiring more users. So you’re stuck in not a vicious cycle, but a stagnant cycle.For entrepreneurs from a decade plus ago, data used to be readily available online. You could crawl it (ex. Airbnb crawling apartment listings from Craigslist), or subscribe to it via RSS feeds that publishers were widely distributing. Platforms like Facebook and Google were also generous with their data providing robust API access (remember all the social games that used Facebook’s Graph API?). There was once even an entire category of products called mashups predicated around this idea of shared data that was composable.Unfortunately for entrepreneurs today, data is no longer easily accessible. RSS has been largely abandoned, most sites prohibit crawling and will sue to prevent it, and platform APIs from Facebook and others have either been shut down entirely or severely limited. More than ever, the web is a collection of walled data gardens controlled by a handful of gatekeepers and for good reason: the data and the infrastructure running that data is incredibly valuable. Gartner last year reported that 80% of the global cloud infrastructure market is controlled by just 5 companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei. It’s no coincidence that these are 5 of the most valuable technology companies in the world.The “haves” (companies with data) generally no longer want to share with the “have nots” (startups), which is why Web3 has become so attractive to entrepreneurs: you get to build with data in Web3. With blockchains, data is freely available to everyone. There are no gatekeepers to blockchain data because ownership is decentralized across tens of thousands of individuals or entities running their own shared copies of the data. You can spin up your own Ethereum node in a matter of minutes and download the entire blockchain onto about 1TB of storage. That would fit on many laptops so there’s not a lot of expensive infrastructure you need either.Because of blockchain ledgers, data access in Web3 is equal. Every startup has access to the same tokens, wallet addresses, transaction history, etc. and can build as complete a customer experience as any other company. We’re all “haves” in Web3, but is what we have useful? In other words, Web3 startups can now build new products that are filled from day one with all of this public blockchain data. But does this public blockchain data help make products that customers actually want to use?There has been one dominant customer value proposition for all Web3 startups this year. One powerful use case that all of their Web3 products — from games to art to fitness tracking — have been helping customers with: making money. During the last crypto bull market, every Web3 product became a speculative asset, and making money became the only scenario Web3 companies had to think about. When your product promises to generate positive returns for customers, it doesn’t have to promise much else.Take for example NFTs, which rocketed in popularity this year with millions of people owning them. In the bull market, NFT startups focused all their energy on helping those million users make money because the primary use case for NFTs was financial speculation. In their pursuit of driving up the price, most NFT product innovation centered around building reward systems for holding onto NFTs (i.e. staking) as well as creating walled gardens around NFT ownership (i.e. token gated content). But those features came at the expense of investments into arguably more interesting product explorations like being able to do things with NFTs and have them interact with other projects.Remember, NFTs are stored on blockchains where the data is freely accessible by anyone. Therefore, Web3 entrepreneurs should be building all sorts of novel, interoperable experiences with NFTs, just like Web2 entrepreneurs did with mashups. But because everyone was so obsessed with just the floor price, NFT projects built entire products designed to keep people from doing anything with their NFTs or having them interact with any other project. The pursuit of financial speculation above all else took data that was inherently open and made it closed.But now we’re in a downmarket where returns are negative. Web3 products can no longer rely on just the use case of making people money, and have to provide other value to earn the time and patronage of customers. We’re going to see a lot of entrepreneurial time and energy shift from innovating on financial speculation to pursuing new ideas for what you can do with data stored on shared ledgers besides making money. Will customers find these new scenarios valuable? Will products filled with public blockchain data be useful?Who knows for sure. But because entrepreneurs still want to build Web3 startups and investors want to fund these companies, we’re about to find out."

Becoming a leader as a first-generation immigrant,Helena Seo,"Jan 7, 2020",https://medium.com/design-doordash/becoming-a-leader-as-a-first-generation-immigrant-4b9a883489dc?source=home---------56------------------0----------,"Although we’re living in an era in which many companies advocate for diversity and inclusion, I am often still the only female director in the room in the tech industry. Even more often, I find myself to be the only first-generation immigrant who learned English as a second language.This is interesting given almost 27% of the population in California is foreign-born immigrants and 45% of people speak a different language at home.Was I luckier? Was I smarter? Probably not.I have been pondering what made me different and how I leveraged my unique immigrant experience for the last 20 years in the U.S. I hope that others like me can benefit from my story.Once upon a time in 1999, I flew from Korea to San Francisco with only a single piece of luggage in my hand. Many people would say this sounds like the American dream.But living and studying in the U.S. wasn’t all unicorns and rainbows. Overcoming the language barrier was harder than I’d expected. Grammar was all backwards from Korean, and there were so many words, idioms, expressions and nuances I had to learn from the scratch. My brain, ears, and mouth always seemed uncoordinated. I always felt overly self-conscious about my word choices, and I worried whether people even understood me. Looking back, it probably took me 10+ years to feel comfortable ordering a pizza over the phone.Cultural adjustment was even harder. When I was growing up back in Korea, I was trained to listen and read between the lines. Classes were usually one-way lectures, and I didn’t learn how to form and express an original opinion. Being opinionated or expressing emotions was considered rebellious, pompous or rude.When I studied Design at the California College of the Arts, I behaved like the good student I was taught to be — obedient and hard-working. However, professors used to put me on the spot for being too quiet in the corner. I felt guilty for not being able to contribute in class, but it was even more terrifying not to know how to behave differently.There were numerous times when I wanted to leave it all behind and go back to Korea where could comfortably blend in with people who had similar backgrounds, spoke the same language, and understood me for who I was. However, I didn’t like the idea of resigning and was determined to stand on my feet in the U.S.20 years later, I’m glad I didn’t give up, and I treasure those difficult yet unique experiences that helped me become the person I am today. There are many things that I learned to appreciate because I’ve lived a foreigner’s life. They also influenced my leadership style in the following way:My constant worry that people may not have understood me and the realization that I could no longer just “read between the lines” has turned me into an over-communicator and a straight shooter. I would rather be a leader who is an open book than a mysterious black box. I find that proactive communication and directness helps get people on the same page faster and prevents second guessing. It’s important for me to know that my team stays up to date so they can make the best informed decision, and I don’t become the blocker of critical data.Because English is a second language, the reality is that I will never be as eloquent or inspiring with my words as native speakers. Realizing this helped me develop into a doer with a strong bias toward action. I don’t feel as engaged sitting in meetings full of endless philosophical discussions that don’t lead to any progress. I’m most satisfied when we get down to actually solving the problem and moving the needle. I also love working with and hiring other doers who can move mountains with me in the most productive and efficient way possible. Because of this trait, I feel I am most useful in situations where execution is key.Vividly remembering the devastating feeling of “I’m not understood for who I am” taught me the importance of creating an authentic environment where everyone is accepted. This includes individuals’ different backgrounds, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. People can only excel and perform when they can be who they are. Pretentious, disingenuous culture is toxic, and it makes people focus on things other than the quality of work itself. I strive to build an open, honest, and transparent culture where everyone feels safe to make mistakes, freely talk about their experiences, and learn from each other.Having been the vulnerable person who was silently sitting in the corner, it’s important for me to include everyone in the room. I love leading discussions where everyone felt their voices were heard (introverts and extroverts alike) and they contributed to something big and meaningful. This doesn’t mean including everyone in every meeting and asking everyone for their opinion. This means that meetings need to be more thoughtfully and intentionally “designed” — from room/location, time, duration, agenda, and attendees. Even small things like sending the agenda in advance and recapping the meeting outcomes afterwards helps every meeting become more inclusive and participatory.I always picture what each meeting will look like in my head before scheduling it. What are the potential conversation dynamics and outcomes? What should the tone of the discussion be? Whose voice will be loudest in the room and who might feel more isolated? Some may think this is overly calculated, but I believe this is the minimal amount of preparation you need to do as an empathetic leader.In Korean, there’s a concept called “noon-chi.” It’s almost impossible to find the exact equivalent in English, but the best possible translation is probably “tact.” It’s the skill of reading between the lines and acting sensibly based on a tactful interpretation of the situation. This is the virtue I was taught in Korea. It’s the sixth sense that enables you to read people’s emotional states and relate to them. When noon-chi is combined with empathy, authenticity, and self-awareness, you can lead teams with high emotional intelligence.Emotional intelligence also isn’t a mythical qualification for leaders and managers. It’s something we should be looking for in every hire because they are our future leadership bench. In interviews, I try to keenly observe the following things about each candidate: Do they interact with team members respectfully throughout the process? Are they self-aware? Do they want what we’re looking for? Can they put themselves in other people’s shoes? Even small things like turning their laptop screen toward others (even if it means they have to read their presentations upside down) go a long way.There are a lot of first-generation immigrants in the U.S., yet it was hard to find an article about everyday leadership by immigrant leaders.Hopefully this article will shed light on the subject from a different angle and inspire others who are going through similar experiences. I’d love to stay connected in the immigrant design community and learn from everyone’s stories.

How I Use Slack,Gabriel Peal,Oct 25,https://gpeal.medium.com/how-i-use-slack-b0dbf06d9a18?source=home---------100------------------0----------,"Slack may be the single most important digital tool that I use every day. I switch to Slack hundreds of times per day (sometimes just for a second or two), send over 20,000 messages per year, am a member of 180 channels at work, and actively participate in 6 workspaces.Over the years, I have found a number of settings and features that have allowed me to stay on top of the firehose that it can be at times. None of my tips are specific to any one company and several people have found them useful so I figured it would be useful to share my personal Slack tips with the world.The very first setting I change in any Slack org is to only show unread channels and conversations. You can do so here. This is invaluable. Slack channels and DMs are often temporary and pile up over time. The transient nature of channels is a feature (see below). However, once old ones start piling up, it becomes untenable quickly.Slack allows you to group channels into sections. Think of them as folders for channels. Instead of one long list, you can arbitrarily group channels with a title + emoji.The most common way to use sections is by team/domain. However, I have found that making sections based on priority helps me stay on top of things much better. As I mentioned, I am in 180 channels in my work org alone. However, the degree to which I care about new messages varies greatly.My solution is to create four channel sections: tier 1, 2, 3, and rarely.When pinging somebody, never start with an open-ended “hello”. This website makes my point better than I could@channel will notify all members of the channel on desktop and mobile even if they are not working, sleeping, etc.@here will only notify people who are actively working.Both should be used with extreme caution. Think twice before using either. Is your message time-sensitive and relevant for everybody in the channel? If not, don’t use them.Slack outlines the differences here.This point is worth mentioning twice. Don’t overuse @here. Be respectful of people’s attention. If you wouldn’t stand in the middle of the office with a megaphone and announce your message to everybody, it’s probably not the right tool to use.Group DMs are useful for reducing clutter in public channels. However, the fun stops when you decide to loop in somebody new. Suddenly, you have a new group DM and that person can’t see what you were talking about before.Temporary channels also allow you to have multiple topical conversations with the same or a similar group of people at the same time.Finally, group DMs are a nightmare to find if you participate in multiple with similar groups of people. You have to remember the exact permutation of people in order to get back to it multiple days later.If you want to add somebody to a channel, add them directly instead of sending a message tagging them. There is no ready to mark the channel as unread for everybody just to add a new person.Channels should be public by default. Unless there is a very good explicit reason to make it private, make it public. It is good for culture and trust but also makes decisions and conversations searchable.Did you read a channel but aren’t in a headspace to respond? Option-click a message and Slack will move the unread marker to right above the message you clicked.Unread channels not doing it for you? You can have Slackbot remind you about a specific message at a specific time like this.Still not ready? You can snooze it again from the Slackbot reminder.In Slack, you can pin messages to keep them readily accessible to anybody in the channel. However, bookmarks are often more useful. Channels have a persistent bookmark bar at the top (once you have at least one) and let you pin any link, not just other messages.Press cmd+k or cmd+t to open the “jump to” window. You can type any channel, DM, or group DM from there.Press cmd+/ to see a list of all keyboard shortcuts. Find some that work well for you! They’re worth taking the time to learn.Did you send a message and immediately realize you made a typo? Press the up arrow and Slack will let you edit the most recent message you sent (even if it’s not the most recent message in the channel).If you type +: in a channel, Slack will pop up the emoji picker. Whatever you pick will be added as a reaction to the last message in the channel. Without the plus, it will send your emoji as its own message.I don’t use this feature very often but Slack allows you to cmd+click a channel to open it side-by-side with another channel.Slack Workflows can be used to create welcome messages when people join the channel.You can make your Slack workspace feel on brand or differentiated from your other workspaces by using themes. The theme settings provides a handy string that can be pasted into Slack and shared with coworkers which allows them to apply the same theme with one click.Love it or hate it, Slack is an integral tool at most companies. It can be a firehose at times but with a few tweaks, it can be extremely manageable. Hopefully, you learned a few new things. Feel free to leave a comment or let me know on Twitter what you think or if there is anything I missed."

Drawing the Line and Our Moral Obligations,Scott Galloway,Oct 29,https://medium.com/@profgalloway/drawing-the-line-and-our-moral-obligations-b7278565eff3?source=home---------80------------------0----------,"There was controversy this month involving Kanye West. You can catch up here; I won’t reiterate it. I believe Kanye is ill, and I’ll return to ignoring him soon after this post. This post is about Adidas, Gap, CAA, and his other corporate partners. It is about the moral obligation we have to draw a line.Authoritarian power, fascism especially, often rests on the persecution of a group. Fascists ascribe the problems of society to the influence of a minority and argue that controlling or eliminating that group will solve a social ill. The most popular target for this form of social weaponization, for hundreds of years, has been the Jews.Making up 2% of the U.S. population, and only 0.2% of the world’s population, Jews are, year after year, the target of more anti-religious hate crimes than any group. In the two-year period 2001–02 bookending 9/11 — when Islamic terrorists killed 3,000 people — the FBI identified 636 anti-Islam hate crimes in the U.S., up from just 61 in the two prior years. Over the same period the FBI identified 1,974 anti-Jewish hate crimes — three times as many as directed at Muslims, more than half the religious hate crimes committed during the period.The anti-Islam number was the anomaly. Year after year, more hate crimes are committed against Jewish Americans than against any other group except Black Americans. (There are six times as many Black Americans, and in total they suffer twice as many hate crimes.) The situation is similar abroad and over time. Persecution of the Jews is so common, there’s a Yiddish word for being massacred: pogrom. QAnon is strange and vile, but likely ends up only a stain on this American era. Antisemitism is history’s most enduring and deadly conspiracy theory.That’s why special attention should be paid to tropes like “the Jewish media.” The real demon, of course, is demonization, of any target. The history of discrimination and violence against “out” groups is extensive, from the Armenian genocide, to the mass killings of Christians by ISIS, to China’s detainment of Uyghurs, and much, much more. In fact, the Nazis did not limit their attacks to Jews alone. They targeted Romani people, Black people, homosexuals, and the handicapped. Whoever the target, identifying a group, blaming them for society’s problems, and encouraging persecution, including violence, against them is the fascist playbook. We cannot ignore these tactics in the rantings of billionaire celebrities, regardless of what we think of their music, their shoe designs, or their mental health.A companion tactic is the assertion of victimhood by the fascists themselves. “Replacement theory” is the noxious combination of both, asserting that the persecuted minority will somehow supplant the majority. The rhetoric of fascism is like a battery, drawing energy from contradiction. A self-proclaimed billionaire, for example, wailing about how oppressed he is.We have incorrectly conflated the liberal tradition of “free speech” with neutrality, with protecting the dark shoots of fascism in the name of tolerance. By the time speech has flowered into actions that cannot be ascribed to a “lone wolf” or the “mentally ill,” it has ripened into a movement. Movements are harder to stop, and the cost of resistance becomes so high that good people stop doing and saying the right thing as the understandable instinct for self-preservation kicks in. Later, we find eloquence and grace only in our regret.I have the feeling that we let our consciences realize too late the need of standing up against something that we knew was wrong. We have therefore had to avenge it, but we did nothing to prevent it. I hope that in the future, we are going to remember that there can be no compromise at any point with the things that we know are wrong.— Eleanor RooseveltStanding up against the rhetoric of hatred has nothing to do with censorship. There is no law forbidding people from employing the rhetoric of oppression, nor should there be. But no principle obligates us to accept them in media or business relationships.A pillar of state-sponsored horror is the steady normalization of stereotyping and blaming. One person ranting about the Jews or anyone else is readily identified as an outlier and ignored. But as these claims multiply, as they have recently, they seem less outrageous. Political scientist Joseph Overton postulated that at any time there is a range of policies the population deems acceptable, but this “window of discourse” is not constant. It’s become a strategic objective of extremist groups to shift the “Overton window” over time toward their position by using rhetoric and advancing policies just outside the current scope of societal acceptance. And as the volume of hateful rhetoric rises, as research has shown, so too does hate crime.The rise of fascism — the normalization of hatred — is concomitant with the accommodations of powerful people who register political and financial gain by looking the other way. “Appeasement” is historically associated with Neville Chamberlain, the U.K. Prime Minister who caved to Hitler’s territorial demands rather than risk war with Germany — only to make the eventual war more costly. Chamberlain is unfairly singled out. Much of the British ruling class supported his position, and the U.S. Congress passed law after law barring aid to those threatened by the Nazis until Pearl Harbor made such a position untenable. Accommodation inside Germany began years earlier, with Hitler’s rise to power (via an election) in 1932.Although Chamberlain is the poster child for appeasement, often the key enablers of fascism are not politicians, but corporations. Large companies benefit from stability, the expansion of their nation’s sphere of influence, and the centralization of power at the expense of the individual — many of the central themes of fascism. It’s no surprise that corporate power is often the handmaiden to authoritarian rule. I write that not as an indictment of corporations — corporations are essential. They are how we organize human effort to accomplish extraordinary things, from electric cars to vaccines. But as corporations become more powerful, their rejection or enablement of hate speech takes on additional importance.Corporate accommodation of and support for the Nazis is well documented, from Adidas to Volkswagen to Krupp to IG Farben. Multinationals flooded into Pinochet’s Chile as he murdered his political opponents by the thousands. Vladmir Putin’s Russia has made “oligarch” (once simply a term for a member of a ruling clique) into a synonym for business leader. The risk is even greater today, considering the role corporations play in modulating our national discourse. The pure pursuit of profit can lead to dark places. There has to be a line, a moral consideration in place.Drawing that line can be hard, because the leaders of large companies are culturally inclined toward, if not political neutrality, avoiding political adventurism. Corporations take political positions for business reasons, and 99% of the time, the best position is none. Donate to both sides, lobby for regulatory capture, and then stand on the sidelines.But neutrality in the face of evil is not neutrality. Amorality is too easily hijacked by the immoral. Hannah Arrendt was fascinated by Adolf Eichmann, the architect of Hitler’s death camp system. He evidently had no ideology of his own, just a “manifest shallowness,” she wrote, “which made it impossible to trace the incontestable evil of his deeds to any deeper level of roots or motives.” If Meta were to change its name again … “Manifest Shallowness” strikes me as a decent fit.If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.— Desmond TutuWhich brings us back to Kanye. And to the corporations that did business with him. Their decision to sever ties is important. Not because they need to “cancel” Kanye. It’s not about Kanye, but drawing a line, arresting the normalization of the demonization of a minority.In the case of Adidas, the ink for this line will cost shareholders hundreds of millions, if not billions, in shareholder value. The shoe maker has been criticized for waiting 10 days to cut ties. Ten days is an eyeblink in history (and even if management made the decision in 10 minutes, the logistics and legalities of responsibly disentangling a multibillion dollar relationship take time). The company should be commended for its actions.As expensive as it was, Kanye did Adidas, the corporate world, and maybe America, a favor. As John Oliver put it, “The answer to where you draw the line is literally always ‘somewhere.’” If you never draw one, you forget how. So when someone goes to “death con 3,” society’s writing hand rediscovers penmanship. It helps to practice our cursive so we know we can do it. Drawing a line is a chance to remind yourself, your employees, your shareholders, and your customers that you’d rather take a stand now, when the cost is only profits vs. something much worse.In writing and presentations, I often point out that much of my success is due to my circumstances — being born in America, getting a state-sponsored education, etc. But the real roots of my good fortune run even deeper. During the Blitz, my mom was a 4-year-old Jew, sleeping in the London tube. Had the British not drawn a line, and then the Americans and Russians, it’s likely that a 21-mile-wide strip of water would have been breached, and my mother’s life would have ended with a train ride. And someone else would be writing this newsletter.It should be noted: The allies drew a line against fascism and potential invasion, not antisemitism. The costs would have been less dear had we drawn those lines earlier. The line on Kanye should have been drawn sooner. Every elected leader, citizen, and CEO must ask themselves, Where is my line? To answer the question: We must first decide there is one.Life is so rich,P.S. If you’re a marketing leader, I’m doing a free, exclusive Q&A for you on Nov. 10 from 1 to 2 p.m. ET.

mericans are living through a series of escalating crises. The planet is warming as geopolitical tensions grow. The global economy is teetering. Worse still, our ability to address these crises is held back by a deeply dysfunctional political system — one governed by an unelected conservative Supreme Court and which faces the possibility of an outright coup.With a decisive midterm around the corner, it is tempting to feel powerless in the face of such immense tides, or to cling to the hope of permanent electoral victory. Neither of these options, however, is sufficient. Instead we must meet the urgency of this moment by organizing ourselves politically and employing proven tactics of change.F
ollowing the election of Donald Trump, America’s left enjoyed a militant resurgence. The women’s march formed alongside a growing movement for black lives and heroic struggles of indigenous resistance. Groups like the DSA flourished, while progressives made impressive gains against the ineffectual Democratic establishment. These successes, however, did little to materially change the country. There were (impressive!) social gains in mainstreaming #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, to the point that major corporations adopted social justice framings knowing they play well with most consumers. However, these movements did not hold back the tide of reactionary politics. The Women’s March did not prevent Roe from being overturned, nor did the March for Science keep America in the Paris Agreement.I do not mean to disparage the efforts to resist Trump. As someone who marched dozens of times, spoke at rallies, and even began my own moderately successful youth organization, I deeply appreciate all those who were motivated and took action in the Trump years. Indeed, the formation of activist communities in once-dormant liberal communities may be the most meaningful, lasting victory of the “resistance.” But, facing urgent crises, it is critical that we recognize our tactics were ultimately unsuccessful in coercing an unwilling government into changing its behavior. Most of our victories came from elections, and relying on elections is, frankly, what got us into this mess.The main exception to this was, of course, the Black Lives Matter uprisings following the murder of George Floyd. It is easy to forget in the chaos of covid, but we all lived through the largest mass protest in US history — one which lasted months and featured the burning of precincts and even outright expulsion of police from some areas. While many of these victories were temporary, some were not. The conviction of Chauvin, for example, would have been vanishingly unlikely if not for massive, organized, and confrontational protests. In my own community, transitions of funding away from police and towards programs which actually reduce crime went from impossible to inevitable in only two years — a victory cemented by elections, but won through organizing.What the 2020 uprisings can teach us, then, is that directly confronting the powerful wins concessions while visibility actions (like marches) are more suited / limited to network building.Taking that lesson to today, I would urge you to look into organizing your community or workplace into a union for the purpose of developing real, confrontational power. Not all struggles are fought in the streets, and our greatest power may very well be our ability to withhold labor and rent. We live in a financial and political system which depends wholly upon our compliance and disorganization. If we were able to coordinate debt, rent, or general labor strikes, we could bring the powerful to their knees.There was a time when Americans knew the power of organization. Our lives have been defined by institutions built by collective struggle, from the voting rights act to the national labor relations act & board. Though we must acknowledge that these institutions are crumbling, the fact that they were won in the first place — often in spite of a hostile and deeply violent ruling class — proves that we can win again. And with the rise of the Starbucks Workers, the Amazon Labor Union, national tenant organizing, and an increase in labor organization nationally, we are already beginning to feel our power build.As
a member of the Greater Boston Tenants Union I am relearning the languages of community and struggle. I work with my fellow tenants to educate them, organize them, and hopefully, to win concessions from landlords. I was fortunate to see Teamsters President Sean O’Brien speak in Boston months ago. Now leading one of the nation’s most essential and powerful unions, Sean called on us all to prepare for a general strike — an inspiring change from the tepid unionism of the 2010s. This same process is being replicated all over the US, both in existing labor unions and in new struggles. People are standing up to the crises we face and building the power to overcome them. You should stand with us.If you, like me, fear for your future, it’s time to take matters into your own hands, and organize for a better world.Organize your work place.Organize fellow tenants.Organizer with debtors."

Tyrion Lannister and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,Elliot Graebert,Dec 2,https://medium.com/@elliotgraebert/tyrion-lannister-and-the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-ee572a276064?source=home---------5------------------0----------,"Stephen R. Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a staple amongst the productivity genre of self-help books. It was written over 30 years ago, yet it remains a best seller, often handed out at offsites or during company onboardings. The key to its success is not just the raw content, but the framework that Stephen uses to present the information:The habits flow from one to the next. The first three are about taking responsibility and aligning your life to achieve your goals. The next three are about effectively working with other people. And the final habit is about the sustainability of your life in pursuit of those goals.While this framework is great, I read this book ten years ago, and I struggle to remember all seven habits.You know what I can remember? Vivid details from Game of Thrones, and I first read that book over 15 years ago. If you are the type of person that can remember half the episodes of The Office but struggle to remember a self-help book, then this post is for you.My intent with this post is to use Tyrion Lannister as a mnemonic device to help you to better remember the seven habits.If you haven’t read or watched Game of Thrones, I don’t recommend reading this post, as there are spoilers ahead. With that being said, here’s a brief reminder of who Tyrion is.Tyrion is the youngest son of the richest man in a war-torn land. As a dwarf, he is dismissed and disdained by a world that values physical prowess over mental acuity (which is Tyrion’s greatest strength). Tyrion is a well-written, flawed character whose proclivity for drink and biting wit made him a fan favorite among the Game of Thrones audience. As an imperfect character, he has many ineffective moments in which not employing the seven habits drives him to ruin. However, in his best moments, there are many parallels between what he does and what Stephen Covey is trying to express.If you like this post, please 👏 , subscribe, or follow me on medium or LinkedIn to let me know I’m on the right track!“Habit 1 is about taking responsibility for your life. Proactive people recognize that they are ‘response-able.’ They don’t blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behaviour. They know they can choose their behaviour. Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find external sources to blame for their behaviour. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and performance, and they blame the weather.”Being proactive is the foundation upon which the other habits rely. The dictionary definition of being proactive is taking action to control your future, but Stephen Covey uses it to mean that you are responsible for your actions and not a victim of other people’s actions. He’s not focused on your ability to control the outcome but rather on your ability to control yourself. Reactive people think in the opposite way, always blaming their circumstances or others for their poor behavior.Let’s look at some cases in which Tyrion was both proactive and reactive.Early on in the books, Tyrion was captured and thrown into the sky cells in the Eyrie. Tyrion could have sat and waited for his brother to come rescue him (which multiple people suggested), but instead, he chose to proactively secure his own freedom. Even when his jailor, Mord, beat him, he refused to let Mord control his response. In the TV series, viewers watch as Tyrion works hard to maintain his composure and stay in control of his responses.Have you ever witnessed a situation at work where one person gets frustrated and raises their voice, and then someone else matches their tone, and the situation escalates? Eventually, things devolve, and no one walks away happy. Imagine how different it would be if they had acted like Tyrion with Mord. Throughout my career, I’ve often coached people on finding the “reasonable response to an unreasonable situation.” This is Tyrion in a nutshell.Now, Tyrion doesn’t always act this way — it was not acting this way that led to his initial downfall. In particular, Tyrion’s family was able to elicit a reactive (non-proactive) response. Joffrey (his nephew) could easily provoke a reaction out of Tyrion. Those reactions led to his being jailed and sentenced to death. It is difficult to remain in control with people you have a history with, which is why family get-togethers can be so stressful. This is probably why Vars and Littlefinger were so much more effective than Tyrion, when it came to Joffrey.When trying to avoid reactive behavior, picture Tyrion reacting to Joffrey. It ruined his life, and reactive behavior can ruin yours. Don’t allow someone else’s actions to control your behavior.When thinking of proactive behavior, picture Tyrion escaping the Sky Cells. When presented with a difficult situation, take control and create the future you want — ideally, one where you survive to fight another day.“Habit 2 is the ability to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes. It is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There is a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation. The physical creation follows the mental, just as a building follows a blueprint.”Stephen Covey’s habits all build upon one another. Proactive people have the drive to seek improvement, and the second habit (begin with the end in mind) ensures that one’s energy is focused on a goal. Without a goal, you are likely to be aimless and unsuccessful. While this sounds straightforward, many people do not start with an end goal in mind, and their hard work never creates the future they want. Once you’ve set an end goal, the next steps are to create a plan (mental creation) and then execute it (physical creation).For the second habit, the best metaphor is the defense of King’s Landing, also known as the battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion proactively took it upon himself to lead the defense of the city (despite constant hindrances from Joffrey and Cersei). Let’s view this from the angle of the second habit:Tyrion’s Goal: Don’t die. This was a simple goal, but very motivational. If the professional world had the same stakes, I think we’d find it much easier to create alignment across teams. Hmm…Tyrion’s Plan: Find a way to defend against vastly superior numbers. Once Tyrion set his goal, he needed a plan that negated Stannis’ superior numbers. Tyrion poured over maps, debated with Varys, and conspired with the pyromancers. He determined where Stannis would attack and how he would compete against superior forces: setting the river on fire (the wildfire explosion).Execution: Don your armor. Finally, the reader’s favorite part — the battle itself.The second habit is not complicated. Being proactive without a goal isn’t going to win the war. Having a goal but no plan won’t help you overcome your enemies. And having a plan that you can’t execute is likely a sign of insanity. To apply the second habit in your life, picture Tyrion trying to stay alive (the goal), pouring over maps (the plan), and fighting on the beach (the execution). Find your King’s Landing and defend it.“Habit 3 is the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. Habit 3 is the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2. Habit 1 says, ‘You are the creator. You are in charge.’ Habit 2 is the first mental creation, based on imagination, the ability to envision what you can become. Habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation.”Proactive people (habit 1) start by choosing a goal (habit 2), and habit 3 is about taking your first steps. I’ve worked with leads who were proactive and knew their goals but poorly prioritized their time — exactly like Ned Stark. He swept into King’s Landing and immediately began making waves. He didn’t prioritize cultivating a solid base and, in the end, was betrayed by the city guard, the small council, and the King. He tried to take a shortcut, and his neck was cut short as a result.In the early books, Tyrion is wavers between being both effective and ineffective. There were two key moments when he became Hand of the King in which he demonstrated he was a keen believer in the fourth habit of putting first things first.(1) Tyrion replaced the commander of the city guard.Tyrion knew that Ned (the former hand of the King) had been betrayed by the commander of the city guard. This betrayal came at a crucial moment and was primarily the reason Ned died. Ned entirely skipped gaining the allegiance of the city guard and assumed that they would follow him because of their morals. While Ned was exceptionally proactive (habit 1), he entirely failed at habits 2 and 3: having a plan and executing it in the correct order.Tyrion was much more thoughtful, and he replaced the commander with Bronn, his (mostly) loyal mercenary companion. The theatrics of the event were great because the audience had no reason to expect this outcome (as the commander had not done anything against Tyrion). Tyrion was proactively fixing the most important problems first.(2) Tyrion identified loyalties amongst the small council.Tyrion planted information about a “secret plan” with three other members of the small council. The rumor was something that his arch-rival (Cersei) would be interested in, but each of the three had a slightly different version of the same rumor. When Cersei confronted him about the rumor, Tyrion immediately knew which council member was the source of the leak. I absolutely loved watching this play out — it was brilliant writing. It was also a perfect example of putting first things first.This was probably the most brilliant maneuver Tyrion ever made, and he followed it up with a blunder that nearly ruined him. Tyrion’s emotions got the better of him (thanks to his toxic family), and he failed to utilize habit 2. Tyrion reacted by throwing Pycelle in prison instead of using him as a known spy. Knowing that Pycelle was the leak, Tyrion could have fed him information to mislead Cersei. He wasn’t thinking about his end goals in this case but rather letting himself be reactive.Mental image: Be like Tyrion with the commander of the city guard and the small council. Do first things first, lest you get beheaded like Ned.“Habit 4 is about seeing life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive one. Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. We both get to eat the pie, and it tastes pretty darn good!”A win-win situation is one in which you seek out solutions that allow both parties to get ahead. People often view situations as a zero-sum game: one party wins, and one party loses. Stephen Covey disagrees with this mindset and instead challenges you to do better.What better example is there of a win-win situation than when Tyrion convinces the hill tribes to fight for him? Tyrion had just escaped from the Eyrie, accompanied by Bronn. The Hill Tribes ambushed them (led by Shagga), yet Tyrion turned the tables. He didn’t just bribe them to let him live; he also convinced them to join him as his personal vanguard. The tribesman got the weapons and plunder they wanted, and Tyrion got his own mini-army.The best example of a win-win I’ve seen in a professional environment was between a product team and my team (the platform team). The product team wanted more features, but my team didn’t have the bandwidth. Instead of fighting, the product team reprioritized its recruiting to hire more platform team members. At the time, this blew my mind. I was fully prepared for a fight, but instead, I got a larger team, and the platform team got its features.Mental image: When in a conflict at work, picture Tyrion and Shagga and think, “how can I create a win-win situation?”“Habit 5 is about how most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. You listen to yourself as you prepare in your mind what you are going to say, the questions you are going to ask, etc. You filter everything you hear through your life experiences, your frame of reference. You check what you hear against your autobiography and see how it measures up. Consequently, you decide prematurely what the other person means before they finish communicating.”One of the things that made Tyrion so formidable (even given his stature) was his willingness to seek understanding. When I think “seek first to understand,” I visualize Tyrion heading north to the wall in the very beginning of the books/show. He wanted to see for himself what the Night’s Watch was all about. He spent time talking to Mormont, Aemon, Benjen, and Jon Snow, all in his quest for understanding. He didn’t try and push an agenda on them or make changes; he was simply there to understand.He used his experience with Mormont to establish trust with his son, Jorah Mormant. Later, he used his experience with Jon Snow to provide advice to Daenerys. My point is that Tyrion sought knowledge and understanding first, and it paid off down the road.I strongly agree with Stephen Covey’s fifth habit, and I think it is the most important. People constantly fail to seek understanding, and in debates, they are just waiting for their chance to speak. I’m absolutely guilty of this. In my experience, the vast majority of conflicts could have been avoided if both parties sought understanding instead of trying to push their own agendas.When you are in a tough situation at work, ask yourself: have you walked the wall like Tyrion, or are you at home in King’s Landing casting judgment from afar?“Habit 6 is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn’t happen on its own. It’s a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table.”In a synergy, you aren’t looking for someone who is the polar opposite of you but rather someone who complements your weaknesses while also adding to your most critical strengths. Throughout the books, George R. Martin repeatedly wove characters together and demonstrated the power of synergy. Examples of these synergistic pairs includeLet’s focus on Tyrion and Bronn, as they are an example of a synergy that Tyrion created in order to advance his career aspirations. Tyrion was well-read, smart, and quick with politics, money, and strategy. However, his physical stature made him a liability in combat. His synergistic pairing was with Bronn. Bronn was a ruthless warrior, far more interested in winning than in being honorable (which suited Tyrion just fine). With Bronn at his back, Tyrion was able to brazenly walk into risky situations that otherwise would have proven fatal for him.In a professional setting, it’s easy to hire people who have the same skills as you instead of hiring against your weaknesses. I think this is because humans have a tendency to artificially inflate other people’s worth if they share our traits or values. However, when building a team, you need to think about your strengths and weaknesses, especially as they relate to problems you are facing.Mental image: Do you have a Bronn who balances out your shortcomings?“Habit 7 is about preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have: you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.”What restorative activities did Tyrion seek outside his role that made him effective?If you hadn’t guessed already, the obvious metaphor for habit 7 would be Shae and Tyrion’s relationship. Tyrion fought most of his battles with his mind (mental), meaning that his restoration needed to be in the physical and emotional arenas. Without going into details, let’s just say that Shae was what Tyrion needed to balance out the rest of his life.The point is that everyone needs a counterbalance in their life that enables them to bring their best self to work. Early in my career, I was a workaholic, and I threw more and more hours into my job. Because so much of my mental stability was wrapped up in my work, conflicts at work would eat away at me. I struggled to maintain the other six habits in my daily behavior because I was mentally drained at all times.My advice for everyone, regardless of where you are in your career, is this: find something outside of work that you can become truly passionate about. It could be a partner, a pet, competitive drag racing — anything that is not your job. You will find it infinitely easier to let go of things at work and remain cool and collected in the face of unreasonable situations.Mental image: Find your Shae.Both the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Game of Thrones are classic books for a reason. Stephen Covey’s book imparts wisdom, and George R. R. Martin’s book is highly memorable. The combination of the two would be a memorable book of wisdom.This blog post is basically the spark-notes for that book:If you enjoyed reading this post, let me know. If there’s a popular book that you think could make a better metaphor, drop it in the comments!"

Every Day is a Trip,Cai Emmons,Nov 23,https://caiemmons.medium.com/every-day-is-a-trip-7c028808fd02?source=home---------16------------------0----------,"Many of you know that I did a second guided mushroom trip last week, seeking a deeper encounter with death, and wanting to learn how to release my attachment to all I love about life. A tall order to ask of a measly mushroom.I used a different guide this time. Actually, it was two people, a couple, both musicians. Before they came, they asked me to write down my intentions. I wrote: I want to learn how to detach from all that I love about life and to release any fear I have of death. The couple brought with them golden bowls, drums, tuning forks, and a giant gong whose sound from a single beat could transport a person into the stratosphere. They transformed my bedroom with purple drapes and votives. Before we began, they showed me the mushrooms they would make into a tea which Paul would inject into my feeding tube. They were beautiful: gnarled bluish stems like the trunks of eucalyptus trees, their caps undergirded with a yellowish filigree. Some people have asked me: Why use a guide at all? I don’t have a definitive answer to this because I have not taken psychedelics without a guide, but I think guides play an important role in creating an atmosphere, particularly with music, which helps in maintaining a focus on the traveler’s intention. The experience was exactly what I wanted it to be.When the mushrooms took hold, I imagined shedding my body, wriggling out of it like a worm offloading a thick skin, then hovering above as I watched myself being carried away. I sailed into outer space, saw a face that morphed from person to person. When asked if I wanted a second dose I first said no, but then I thought Why not, this certainly isn’t an experience I will ever have again. As I flew off once more, I understood I needed to loosen my control on things, including the specific time I would choose to terminate my life. As we were winding down, the couple sang a beautiful song they’d written about death. I don’t know if I have released all my hold on life, but I am definitely closer than I was before, and I feel an overall calm about facing what lies ahead of me. As the writer Annie Lamott would say, I will be taking it bird by bird.I intended last week to write about the push/pull of my life, the challenge of balancing the many reasons to go with the many reasons to stay. To be or not to be. But I have passed through a portal recently so I’m now in a place in which the pull of staying alive has weakened. Everything I do is difficult to pull off. I need help with the most minor of tasks. My left hand is useless, so I type now with one hand. [A sidebar. There are over 30 muscles in the human hand. They work in concert with the muscles of the wrist and forearm. Every one of those muscles makes a difference. I have learned this as I’ve watched them go. I urge you all to appreciate the complexity and skill of your hands!] I have always been a world class sleeper, but these days even sleep does not provide escape because it’s hard to breathe, and turn over, and my bones, unpadded now from weight loss, hurt. I don’t mean to complain; I am simply describing the reality. People, even those closest to me, have begun to speak to me differently as they pull my arms into sleeves or assist me in the bathroom, and I fully understand that. How do you speak to someone who cannot respond or accomplish the daily tasks of keeping herself alive? I want the release of death, and each morning and night as Paul and I look into each other’s eyes it is with acknowledgment that the end is near.But we have run into a roadblock of my own making — the “good girl” problem; the problem associated with a lifetime of too much striving. Because I have been performative at my doctors’ visits, mustering as much energy as I can, wanting to be a “good patient,” they still see me as a strong and determined warrior with vigor to last me more than six months. To invoke Death with Dignity, two doctors must sign a form saying you have only six months to live. Now it is my task to show my doctors the underlying truth: I know my body well, and I know it’s giving up. I’m going downhill fast. The thought of having to live for six months or more is unfathomable to me — it would feel like a dreadful sentence.Yesterday I realized what I had to do. I had to assert myself clearly. I wrote to my doctor, the one who diagnosed me, and who I adore, and who I perform for, and who is always telling me I am strong and have lots of time ahead of me, and I outlined my current condition, telling him how my quality of life has declined dramatically of late and asking him if he would sign off on Death with Dignity. He replied immediately. Sure, he said, I will do anything for you. He gave me permission to die.One of the reasons I know it’s time to quit is because I have no desire to write more fiction. For my entire life my brain — my whole body — has been in love with words and playing with ideas that might be expressed with words to become poems, or plays, or stories. But now I feel that impulse quieting down. An underdiscussed aspect of writing is that it takes an enormous amount of energy. If your physical body is not in good shape — well-fed, well-rested, exercised — your focus will probably be somewhat fuzzy, and it will be hard to produce good work. When I have printed out — or more accurately, when Paul has printed out — this draft of my new novel, I will be done. I have no doubt I would have written many more novels if I’d had the extra twenty years I expected to have, but that is not to be, and it’s fine. I will now not have to worry about becoming repetitive.It is now the day before Thanksgiving. My family members — sisters and their children and all their partners, as well as the adored baby — arrived last night and will stay for five or six days. I expect it to be a rollicking good time. Cooking and singing and building fires and admiring baby Radley. One of my nieces has put together an Emmons Family Playlist full of songs we have sung over the years. Many new memories we will be created over the next week.I have no idea what to say in conclusion. Perhaps just: Stay tuned and HAPPY THANKSGIVING!Cai"
Nature Speaks: How Environmental Linguistics may help save the planet.,"K. David Harrison, PhD","May 2, 2020",https://medium.com/@dharris2/nature-speaks-how-environmental-linguistics-may-help-save-the-planet-eaea06113ba2?source=home---------53------------------0----------,"Walking through the Siberian forest with Marta, a lifelong huntress and forager, I could sense her reverence. Marta Kongarayeva, born 1930, was among the very last speakers of a language called Tofa. Having dwelled in the forest her entire life, Marta also inhabited a linguistic world that rendered it legible. She named subtle, yet meaningful, signs: tiny flowers blooming on the forest floor, insect chirps, lunar phases, swirly patterns in lake ice, the creak of cedar cones disgorging their nuts.Nature spoke to Marta, telling her the lunar calendar days, when to gather nuts, where to hunt, and how to survive. And Marta spoke back to nature in her Tofa language, invoking the bear to fatten itself for the kill, offering tea to the campfire god for success in hunting, whistling the wood grouse to the hunter’s snare, or serenading a reindeer to nurse her calf. Marta’s lyrical dialogue with nature — which she knew to be capable of both benevolence and severity — was a spiritual practice that kept the world in balance and allowed her Tofa people to thrive in one of the harshest climes on earth. Marta’s Tofa language uniquely expresses “I’ll catch a quail” as a single verb (üšpülläär) and “my two-year-old male castrated domes- ticated rideable reindeer” as a single noun (charym). She could recite twenty Tofa words exclusively denoting body parts of a bear (irezang). Marta knew the name of each bend in the river, directional words that applied only to rivers, and the names of water spirits. These language tools allowed her to wayfind in the forest, harvesting its bounty while respecting its power.Without walking with Marta and listening to her wisdom, it would be hard to grasp her linguistically encoded environmental knowledge (or LEEK, as I call it). Contemplating the forest with an elder, you witness how knowledge springs up from the land, trickles into the observant mind, and is absorbed by cultural practice. It can then be applied to sway nature to human will and to augur its patterns. This seems like magic to someone like me who comes from a culture thoroughly detached from nature and lacks the lexicon of the forest. In fact, it is science, millennia of keen observation and cultural sense-making by astute, nature-attuned minds.Language infuses every environment. Through language, people generate and transmit astounding bodies of nature knowledge, mostly unwritten and stored only in memory. The application of this knowledge creates feedback loops that link human perception and behavior with plants, animals, and non-living elements. How then can one practice environmental studies, ecology, or biological sciences without including and respecting the knowledge base found in the world’s 7,000+ languages, and especially in smaller Indigenous tongues?Linguistic science has much to offer us in understanding climate change, biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. But this is a different ilk of linguistics than what has dominated the academy for the past half century. I’ll call it Environmental Linguistics, a re-attachment of language to nature. For Indigenous peoples, these two were never parted.I went to Siberia to do field linguistics, intending to create a grammar, dictionary, and story collection of Tofa. Grammar, so we are taught in contemporary linguistics, may be extracted from speakers’ minds, captured in recordings, and analyzed for science. As a newly-minted PhD from Yale, I’d had superb theoretical training. But on my walks with Marta, I realized her language did not exist apart from its forest habitat. My training and tools were unfit for the task. Tofa makes little sense in a library or a digital archive— or in Stalinist labor camps where Marta’s friend Varvara Adamova had been exiled just for speaking it. The intimate environmental knowledge Tofa encodes is nonportable, untranslatable, and exists nowhere else on the planet, nor in the minds of any other people. Although I had some nifty analytical tools from linguistics and anthropology, these had not prepared me to grasp the complexity, connectedness, and value Tofa holds for its speakers.Language HotspotsRecently, I’ve been exploring the language-environment interface in the South Pacific, a place remarkably different from Siberia. Vanuatu’s lush tropical islands are home to a self-confident people enjoying the bounty of the sea while managing tourism that showcases their pristine coral reefs and daring land-divers. Vanuatu boasts astonishing bio-diversity, and it’s the world’s #1 “Language Hotspot” (a term I coined in 2007 for the National Geographic Society to help visualize global patterns of language diversity). The Ni-Vanuatu people — a population of just 250,000 — boast a higher ratio of languages to people than anywhere on earth. They can express themselves in one or more of 113 local tongues, as well as Bislama, French, and English.On Futuna Island, I met Anselon Seru, in his mid-20s and renowned for his fishing expertise. Showing off a prized tuna (uorukago) he had netted from his wooden outrigger canoe (waka), Anselon paused to upload a photo of it to Instagram. When I turned on my recorder, Anselon easily named more than 250 species of fish and described their feeding habits, migration patterns, and schooling formations. Many Futuna fish names do not map one-to-one onto the Linnaean scientific taxonomy used by marine biologists. Rather, the Futuna apply a cultural logic of classification and naming that they find apt. For example, two fish that appear identical to a marine biologist and share just one scientific name are called by two distinct names in Futuna, because one sleeps in the daytime and the other at night. To fish, one must also sail, and so I listened as expert navigator Yaugane Misikofe taught the young men the names of 18 winds that make up the Futuna wind compass, a crucial tool for making landfall.On nearby Keamu island, elder David Nasauman taught me the sugar cane calendar, each month named for a different cane variety. David’s son, Wopa Nasauman, named the dozen plant species he had turned into rope, thatch, and posts to build his cyclone house. Martial Wahe explained the eight life stages of the coconut, and Ruben Neriam named thousands of plants, many with curative properties. As part of a five-year project called “Plants mo pipol blong Vanuatu” (Plants and People of Vanuatu), I am working with the Vanuatu Forestry Department and with New York Botanical Garden scientists Michael Balick and Gregory Plunkett to document this valuable knowledge.The foundation for our scientific work is the knowledge base of the Vanuatu people, which they retain as intellectual property while generously sharing. As the botanists collect specimens of nearly 2,000 plants entirely new to modern science, we find that almost every plant is known, named, and used by local people. As Takaronga Kuautonga of Futuna Island remarked: “We have names for all these plants in our language.”Globalization pros and consThese remote communities — in Siberia and Vanuatu — are now within range of cell towers and are active on social media. Eager technologizers, they are crossing the digital divide and creating an online presence for tongues never before heard outside a few isolated villages. They do this intentionally, viewing technology not as a threat but an opportunity. By leveraging the positive value of globalization, they visibilize their cultures, inviting the appreciation of a global audience. They also add to the sum of recorded environmental knowledge.Languages are endangered because they have been conquered, colonized, and oppressed and are now dominated by major global tongues. Tofa is nearing a vanishing point, with a dozen elderly speakers left. As Marta Kongarayeva told me: “Old age is creeping up on me, and soon I’ll go berry-picking. When I go, I’ll take my lan- guage with me.” Futuna counts over 1,000 speakers but is potentially threatened as young people migrate off the island. Both scenarios are sources of concern met with active interventions by community leaders and by outsiders invited to assist.Hope amidst crisisThe world is at a crucial juncture, as it stands to lose an immense portion of its plant, animal, and cultural diversity during this century. Threats to the natural environment are driven by climate change and unsustainable lifestyles. Small languages are falling into oblivion as major global languages expand to dominate human thought and discourse. Saving species from extinction, adapting to climate change, and assisting communities in revitalizing their languages are urgent, yet intertwined efforts.As Neil McKenzie of the Yawuru people of Australia explained to me while demonstrating survival skills in the outback, “If I don’t show you the land, you won’t understand the language. It exists because of the land. It is in close harmony with it.”A sign of hope that we may yet learn to create a sustainable civilization is that humans have done so before, many times over: the Yawuru in their deserts, the Tofa in their Siberian forests, and the Ni-Vanuatu on their bountiful islands. Their languages—and the unique knowledge these encode—enable their survival. These Environmental Linguists have much to teach us, if we will listen. What they know may help save the planet.—K.

A Shortage in Opportunity Leaves a Deficit Generationally,John Rampton,Nov 4,https://medium.com/@johnrampton/a-shortage-in-opportunity-leaves-a-deficit-generationally-4308f8c7887e?source=home---------47------------------0----------,"In January 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an “unconditional war on poverty in America” during his first State of the Union address. Johnson called for an all-out war against poverty and unemployment in the United States.” This involved a series of social programs enacted in 1964–1965 that were considered the most ambitious domestic policy initiatives since the Great Depression.For decades, political leaders and social scientists have debated whether Johnson’s antipoverty programs lifted people out of poverty or trapped them in chains of dependency.As an example, compared to 1964, the official poverty rate has dropped only modestly, from 19% to 15% in 2012. In 2020, the official poverty rate was 11.4%, up 1.0% point from 10.5% in 2019. It is the first increase in poverty in five consecutive years.In addition, nearly 11 million children in America live in poverty. In other words, one in seven children lives in poverty in this country, representing almost one-third of all poor people. Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, child poverty remains alarmingly high.So, what hasn’t the cycle of poverty been broken since President Johnson’s declaration? Despite the fact that there is no single answer, it isn’t dependent on an individual’s characteristics and choices. Rather, generational poverty is about lack of opportunity.Over the past few decades, developmental science has changed the way it understands child poverty. For children, poverty means more than living with fewer necessities. Poverty, especially at its extremes, can adversely affect the development of the body and mind. There is an increased risk, extending into adulthood, for many chronic illnesses and a shorter life expectancy for children living in poverty.Growing up poor increases children’s chances of having poor health, including emotional and behavioral problems, even when poverty doesn’t directly alter their biological systems. Children are exposed to multiple threats to their well-being when they live in poverty. In addition to a lack of “food security,” poor children have diets that are deficient in important nutrients. There are higher rates of chronic health conditions among poor children, including asthma.Despite this, they tend to receive less preventive dental and medical care. In April 2021, a study reported that parents whose incomes did not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) were more than nine times more likely to be uninsured.The National Council found that “Forty-two percent of the population saw cost and poor insurance coverage as the top barriers for accessing mental health care. One in four (25%) Americans reported having to choose between getting mental health treatment and paying for daily necessities.”People living just above the poverty line are particularly affected by this disparity between cost and need.Health Affairs explains, “not all low-income people with serious mental illnesses are eligible for Medicaid because they aren’t disabled enough to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI); they don’t meet other Medicaid eligibility criteria (such as single adults or immigrants), or they are homeless, incarcerated, or too ill to follow through with the enrollment and eligibility process.With states shifting an increasing proportion of their mental health budgets onto Medicaid, fewer state funds are available to provide services for low-income uninsured people with serious mental illnesses who are not eligible for Medicaid.”Creating and widening achievement gaps.When compared with their economically secure peers, children who grow up in poverty are far behind. From infancy onward, there are significant gaps in the development of learning, knowledge, and social-emotional skills. Leaving these early gaps unaddressed will lead to progressive widening. When optimal development is achieved early, further optimal development is possible, whereas when poor development is achieved, these doors are closed.Consequently, poor children lag behind their peers at the beginning of kindergarten, in reading ability in third grade, in self-monitoring skills in eighth grade, and in school attendance. Dropout rates are higher among poor children, and they are less likely to complete their education after high school.For example, schools with high poverty offer fewer advanced courses and fewer experienced teachers. Additionally, fewer dollars are spent on instructors and instructional materials per student.According to the above, high-poverty students receive fewer resources in the classroom than their peers outside of school buildings. These effects are disproportionately felt by students of color.In Virginia, for example, 16% of teachers in the state’s high-poverty schools were in their first or second year of teaching. Furthermore, teachers in high-poverty schools earned about $46,000 compared with over $57,000 in low-poverty schools in 2013–2014.In addition, high-poverty middle and high schools tend to have fewer advanced courses than schools with low concentrations of poverty. As an example, most middle schools with low poverty concentrations (93%) offered Algebra I, while only three-quarters (75%) of middle schools with high poverty concentrations did. In order to establish foundational math skills and prepare students for higher-level math, this course is crucial.Math and science aren’t the only subjects involved. In high-poverty schools, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) classes are less likely to be offered.Income inequality has also fueled a class-based social disconnect that’s led to unfair educational outcomes.“Now, your family income matters more than your own abilities in terms of whether you complete college,” said Robert Putnam, the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). “Smart poor kids are less likely to graduate from college now than dumb rich kids. That’s not because of the schools, that’s because of all the advantages that are available to rich kids.”As a matter of fact, 46 percent of 2020 graduates from high-poverty high schools went to college that fall, compared with 70 percent from low-poverty high schools.Although poor families have many strengths, they also face numerous challenges that can affect their emotional well-being and that of their children. Compared to higher-income parents, poor parents report more stress, aggravation, and depression symptoms. Providing for their families’ material needs can be difficult for parents who do not have sufficient economic resources.It is also less likely that children in poor families have access to books and other educational resources at home, as well as activities, outings, and programs that can enhance their learning opportunities. There is a greater likelihood of housing instability in their families.Further, poverty makes it difficult for parents to maintain a work-life balance that allows them to spend time at home with their children and to be active in school, extracurricular activities, and community activities. Working long hours in a precarious job, without parental leave, sick pay, and other basic support, is more likely for parents on a low income. The flexibility and choice of low-income workers are often limited. For example, they use public transportation and cannot work from home.However, many experimental studies have demonstrated that increasing family income improves the social and academic outcomes of children.Lack of finances makes it difficult for parents to raise their families and live independently. Having poor eating habits, lacking confidence, and optimism can spread to children because parents are their closest role models.As a consequence of the perception of scarce resources, this behavior is also a part of the scarcity mindset.” This mindset traps people in a cycle of insecurity and a struggle to achieve short-term goals.In other words, a scarcity mindset is caused by a perception that resources are limited. Because the bandwidth in our brain is limited, we cannot solve two problems at once.As such, without meeting your current needs, investing in the future is impossible. Planning ahead is also difficult when you have limited funds and are focused on the short term. It would just be like buying the same pair of cheap shoes over and over again instead of investing in a pair of high-quality shoes.There is no doubt that this will have a huge impact on your life. First of all, if you’re worried about running out of money, you stay where you are. Secondly, low-income individuals who thought about a high car repair bill had significantly impaired cognition.As a Jean-Paul Sartre quote goes, “Introspection is always retrospection.” By looking back to the origins of our beliefs about money, we can change our generational patterns of money,” says Dr. Katherine Elder co-founder of Delaware Psychological Services. “Sometimes these patterns exist throughout several generations.”On average, raising a child can cost more than $200,000 over the years, even before higher education costs are considered. As families grow, expenses increase. But the largest expenses often occur far before their peak earning years. Although families across income levels face this challenge, those with the least resources face the greatest financial hardship.Since America’s current policies do not guarantee an adequate standard of living for children, their economic security is directly influenced by their caregivers’ experiences in the labor market. Over the past few decades, caregivers’ work has largely driven changes in child poverty rates.Over the past few decades, even during periods of economic growth, child poverty rates have remained high. Additionally, there has been a dramatic increase in income inequality since the 1970s. Because of this, in 2019, only 3% of total household income went to the poorest 20 percent of Americans, while more than half went to the richest 20 percent.It is estimated that the richest 5 percent had 248 times as much wealth in 2016 as those in the middle of the distribution. In comparison, the poorest 20 percent had no wealth or even negative wealth due to debt.Families across the country suffer from persistent poverty due to rising inequality. However, poverty would have been significantly lower had all families’ incomes grown at the same rate. For example, a U.S. Department of Agriculture report estimates that income inequality accounts for 93 percent of the increase in rural child poverty between 2003 and 2014. There are ramifications beyond just financial inequality. It also contributes to a disparity in child development markers and learning gaps.Economic vulnerability threatens millions of low-income children in families with at least one worker. It is estimated that over 15 million low-wage workers are raising children, and one in ten of these are single parents. The schedules of their jobs are unpredictable, employment is unstable, and they do not receive sufficient benefits or are not eligible for them.Furthermore, the quality of jobs has declined. As a result, job growth will be concentrated in the service sector, where workers in the hospitality, restaurant, care, and retail sectors are often paid less, receive fewer benefits, and do not have as many opportunities for promotion. It has been over a decade since the federal minimum wage was increased, even though low-wage workers saw the most wage growth in states that raised their minimum wages.Over 4 million fewer children would be in poverty in a full-employment economy if wages grew at the same rate as broader economic productivity.Currently, some people are advocating a two-generational model of poverty reduction, meaning that we can’t just focus on children without ensuring that parents have good employment, health, and life opportunities. Consistency is also important.If we want to improve our schools, we must act on it, not just talk about it. Investing at the local, state, and federal levels is essential, but neighborhood investments are also necessary.In spite of the multi-faceted nature of poverty, we can categorize it into two primary categories: culture and believing the lie of worthlessness.Poverty is caused by both internal and external factors in cultures. There are some conditions that are tangible and external, such as:There are also intangible and internal elements. For example, knowledge, aspiration, diligence, confidence, participation in governance, social capital, values, and peace are all important.People of low income often believe that they are failures, which is a lie of worthlessness. Their hope for a better future is hindered by this message of oppression and hopelessness. Due to previous generations living in poverty, the cycle continues and will continue for the next generation as well.Many people do not have a choice but to live in poverty. Most of those living in poverty work very hard to get escape. However, many are born into poverty (intergenerational poverty) and sacrifice their education for the sake of their families’ well-being..Some fall into it due to unexpected medical emergencies or other unforeseen circumstances (situational poverty). In many cases, they work hard at low-paying jobs that are stressful and demanding. Whether visible to you or not, people with disabilities, single parents, international students, veterans, and even your neighbor all face overwhelming obstacles.Children’s development and prospects for the future can be profoundly affected by economic hardship and other types of deprivation — and this affects the nation as a whole as well. Children with a low family income may have difficulties learning and developing cognitively. As a result, behavioral, social, and emotional problems may arise. Moreover, it can adversely affect the health of children. Children who experience severe and chronic hardship when they are young are those at greatest risk.Child poverty is not simply a matter of income. Families with low wages may experience fluctuating incomes due to the instability and unpredictability of their work. A child whose family is in unstable economic circumstances is more likely to suffer negative effects than a child whose family is stable.As well as being associated with difficulties later in life, these effects also contribute to problems in school, adolescent and adult health, employment outcomes, and poverty. Children who grow up in safe, nurturing, and enriching environments are more likely to succeed in school, and to become economically productive and responsible citizens.For children to thrive and grow into healthy, productive adults, parents need financial resources and human and social capital (basic life skills, education, and social networks).The list includes high-quality health care, adequate housing, stimulating early learning programs, good schools, money for books, and other enriching activities.Those facing chronic economic hardship are far more likely than their more affluent peers to suffer from severe stress and depression — both of which are detrimental to their children’s social and emotional development.A Shortage in Opportunity Leaves a Deficit Generationally was originally published on Due.com on Nov. 4, 2022, by John Rampton."

Middle Seat x John Fetterman: Flipping a U.S. Senate Seat from Red to Blue,Middle Seat Consulting,Nov 10,https://medium.com/@MiddleSeatCo/middle-seat-x-john-fetterman-flipping-a-u-s-senate-seat-from-red-to-blue-b744a13cf26a?source=home---------31------------------0----------,"Middle Seat was thrilled to join John Fetterman’s campaign for the U.S. Senate from the very beginning. We’re so proud of our team’s hard work to build such a groundbreaking, successful digital program and are so grateful to have been a part of their incredible campaign team.Wayyyyy back in November 2020, Middle Seat officially began working with John Fetterman and senior advisors (like communications expert Rebecca Katz) to begin building a winning grassroots campaign. We worked closely together for two years, from pre-launch planning through prevailing in a crowded primary and on to Election Night victory.Here’s how Middle Seat drove this critical win:John Fetterman had a following from his successful 2018 campaign for Lieutenant Governor, and he grew that following even more after the 2020 election, when he generated a huge amount of earned media by debunking Donald Trump and the GOP’s election denier lies.This was a foundation upon which we could start building a successful U.S. Senate campaign — but it was still only a foundation. So, before the campaign even launched, Middle Seat assembled a comprehensive strategy that spanned web, email, ads, creative, social media, and texting.We took Fetterman’s clean logo and monotone black-and-white color scheme and turned it into a fun & engaging website and brand experience. Our creative team leaned into a bright yellow accent color (inspired by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates, emphasizing Fetterman’s western Pennsylvania roots) and incorporated emojis and strong textures to bring Fetterman’s vibrant personality into the digital world. As we built out more creative collateral through ads, email, social, and web, we brought the witty and gritty tone of the campaign to life on digital.Our goals from the very beginning were to fire up Fetterman’s existing supporters, as well as to recruit new supporters and mobilize them to take action and give on behalf of the campaign. While Fetterman came to the table with a small email list from his prior campaigns, that list hadn’t been regularly engaged with and contained a number of inactive email addresses, as well as out-of-date data. We knew we would need to work hard to revive as much of that list as we could, as well as to scale up rapidly to build a massive new email list that could support a U.S. Senate race likely to garner national attention and fierce opposition.To kick this process off, we planned a soft launch — an exploratory campaign during which we both primed Fetterman’s existing list for the possibility of a Senate run and invested aggressively in acquiring new supporters. We captured data across digital touchpoints so that the campaign could fully harness and extend the power of this growing grassroots army.This early soft launch was not without its challenges — we had to operate in an environment where political campaigns could not launch new ads on Facebook or Google. As a result, our advertising team sprang into action, building out acquisition testing plans that included dozens of sources of new supporters. This approach was effective — within a week of our soft launch, we hit a 128.50% ROI on our initial investments. These strong results proved that our approach was the right one, and that positioned us to make even larger investments in list growth.When launch day came around, not only did we have all of the necessary digital infrastructure in place to set us up for success, we had a comprehensive multi-day launch messaging plan that spanned every single digital platform and property. This meant we could make a big splash early, capturing attention, driving the narrative, and generating huge fundraising returns.Our plan worked — Fetterman raised more than $450,000 in the first 48 hours of his official U.S. Senate campaign launch. Altogether, this early and successful launch quickly established John Fetterman as the front-runner in what would become a crowded Democratic primary.Because open U.S. Senate seats don’t come about very often, we knew that our competition would be fierce. A key part of our strategy was for Fetterman to launch his campaign first — this meant we could start building support, growing his name recognition, locking down endorsements, and raising money before anyone else. By showing our strength at the very beginning of the election cycle, we planned to generate the resources, attention, and enthusiasm that would establish John as the front-runner.Our strategy was effective — and ultimately necessary, considering that our opposition turned out to be formidable. Our primary opponents included a sitting member of Congress and an incumbent Pennsylvania State Representative, among others. Victory was by no means guaranteed, but our strong footing right out of the gate made sure our opposition would have to gain a lot of ground to catch up; locking down supporters and donors early left our opponents with significantly less room in which to maneuver or gain traction.After launch, we kept up a steady drumbeat of multi-channel engagement to drive interest, action, and donations and to keep our launch momentum going long-term. Ultimately, we raised more than $3.5 million online through Q1 of 2021, building a substantial war chest before any of John’s primary opponents had even entered the race.John Fetterman wasn’t a typical candidate, so we knew he couldn’t have a typical digital program.As a result, our team pushed the boundaries of what a candidate could do online, and ensured that every email, ad, tweet, and text sounded like John Fetterman, not a cookie-cutter Democrat. This became our strength — John’s digital program really stood out in the crowded primary field, and it also stood out in the general election among the many, many other Democratic candidates vying for attention and dollars.In an election cycle marked by a deluge of emails boasting fake 1000x matches and high-pressure, the-sky-is-falling messaging, Middle Seat’s team gave a masterclass in how to make digital programs fun and engaging. We aimed for all of our content to be relatable, funny, personable, and accessible — just like John Fetterman himself.We wrote long-form, personal narratives that told the stories of John, his family, his tattoos, and his western Pennsylvania roots, really driving home his personal narrative and message. We ran ads that stayed true to John and his brand. Our email, texting, and ads programs respected John’s supporters as much as he did — meaning no cheap gimmicks or coercive fundraising asks.Even before his candidacy, John built up a well-known online persona that naturally lent to dynamic digital content. As such, we were able to lean fully into signature Jawn-isms, such as Sheetz vs. Wawa battles, content from his wife Gisele and the Fetterkids (who regularly made appearances on digital verticals), and even content voiced by the family’s internet-famous dogs, Levi and Artie. The success of the latter — including booping the dogs’ noses to make a donation, and text messages authored by our favorite dog besties (ilu!!! 💕) — proved that, regardless of what critics on Twitter say, funny and unique content works.Plus, continually emphasizing John’s western Pennsylvania roots really helped the campaign connect with the communities that would become key to his primary and general election victories. And those deep roots and community connections would become even more important in the general election, where we faced off against New Jersey’s own Dr. Oz.We weren’t just successful at raising money or mobilizing voters (though we did plenty of both!), but we also tried new things and ensured every facet of our program reflected John’s personality. We experimented with out-of-the-box ideas, like a weed facts quiz and archival video content to showcase John’s consistency on the issues, from abortion to the minimum wage. We launched Instagram takeovers with members of the campaign staff, like the Horton Brothers, to not only give insight into the enthusiasm of the campaign, but to put a face on those behind the scenes who know John best. We went where other firms wouldn’t — and leaned in even further.For two years, the Middle Seat team collaborated with the Fetterman campaign on a daily basis to raise millions of dollars online, develop authentic content, and persuade and mobilize voters. When Team Fetterman built up their in-house digital team, we coordinated with them to further elevate this program and to achieve even more messaging, mobilization, and fundraising success.In spring of 2022, we launched a multi-million dollar digital advertising campaign to persuade and mobilize primary voters, working closely with TV, mail, and field to ensure a cohesive strategy and message that took advantage of our early lead and John’s unique voice. And then we did it all again in summer for the general, going even bigger with uniquely-targeted programs for key demographics who are often forgotten or taken for granted in election season (after all, standing up for forgotten people and left-behind communities is what John Fetterman does).At the same time, we were engaged by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to run their coordinated digital campaign, which added even more scale to our GOTV efforts. Middle Seat’s in-house video team built out engaging and authentic ads — and we turned around rapid-response ads literally overnight so we could respond to breaking news while it was still fresh.We built one of the largest email lists in modern politics, a robust texting program, and a unified media approach across channels. We ultimately helped Fetterman grow his email list from 54,000 to more than 3 million people. By the end of this campaign, we spent nearly $6 million in email acquisition and over $1 million in phone acquisition to raise back more than $34 million from just those supporters. We maintained overwhelmingly ROI-positive direct donate campaigns to expand our donor base, and we executed clever persuasion and GOTV campaigns that prevailed against the tens of millions of dollars of Dr. Oz’s self-funding, as well as PAC spending from the GOP.We’re incredibly proud to have been part of Team Fetterman from the very beginning and we’re so thankful that John is representing Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate.For more on our work with the Fetterman campaign, stay tuned! Case study coming soon.And if your campaign is looking for a digital partner, reach out to our team and let’s have a conversation:"

Real talk from a UX researcher,Ki Aguero,Nov 10,https://medium.com/@ki.aguero/real-talk-from-a-ux-researcher-66b0141794bb?source=home---------29------------------0----------,"I was chatting with a colleague the other day about a couple of team members who are at odds with each other, and she told me that I possess a quality she’s never been able to achieve: I’m diplomatic.That was a first.After some reflection, I think that as a researcher, that’s sorta my default mode. I want to get all the information out on the table without judgement and look at it through various lenses.I do my best to avoid bias and understand everyone’s perspective. I have learned how to take it all in and weigh the pieces, and whatever conclusions I draw, I do my best to be conscious of how the news will be received.I’ve been in the field for 10 years, and I’ve started mentoring lately. In the last year I’ve gotten more and more requests to offer recommendations, look at portfolios, and critique first-timers’ resumes.I sometimes wonder if these newbs (yes, condescending, I told you that I took off my diplomacy hat!) really understand what they’re getting themselves into.So here is my least diplomatic way of explaining what it’s like to be a UX researcher.Buckle up.Yeah, okay, so if you’re a professional researcher, chances are good that you’re better than most people at looking at all the little pieces of data and finding the connections, themes, trends, patterns, etc.But those aren’t the dots I’m talking about.I’m talking about the stakeholders across the business, product management, design, and development.All of those people are their own little dots. Silos. Islands. They’re out there, doing their design thing or their business thing. And they miiiiiight be interested in what you’re doing on your research island.I’ve talked before about the importance of research leading to action, because I don’t want to do research just for the sake of doing it. I want to watch the research light a fire under my stakeholders’ asses so they go fix the damn thing that customers just spent hours bitching about.And to get that to happen, I’ve had to spend way more time understanding the politics, funding, and motives underlying my projects. I’ve had to ask questions that sometimes feel super disconnected to the project I’m being asked to do. I’ve had to think through the audience I’m reporting findings back to and figure out what they control and what pressures are on them so that maybe they actually DO the thing that the research says they should do.It’s tedious and sorta exhausting, but when you take those extra steps, you can connect the dots between what you did and what they need to do. It gives your work more power and impact.I’ve conducted moderated interviews for years. I’ve watched hundreds — honestly, it’s probably thousands — of unmoderated user tests. I’ve read thousands of open-ended comments on surveys. I even used to get occasional direct messages from members of a customer panel I managed.Sometimes I get a few stakeholders to observe interviews, but it’s never 100% attendance; most show up to about 25% of sessions. I’ve had one — literally, ONE — product manager ask me for the raw data from a survey so they could read all the open-ended comments for herself (and I think she’s a rock star for it — go, Bianca!).Occasionally, users say something wonderful, or they react positively to whatever site, app, or prototype is being tested, and I love those moments. I still remember a gentleman who was using a note keeping app to organize his adoption documents with his partner, and how we literally cried when I wished him well at the end of the session. I still wonder if he ever got to be a parent, and hope like hell that it was everything he dreamed it would be.But of course most UX research is focused on rooting out pain points, and that means you have to experience a lot of emotional pain by proxy.I’ve had customers lose their shit in user tests. Sometimes I have to give interviewees a minute to collect themselves when we cover sensitive topics. One tester spent literally 18 minutes of an unmoderated test completely STUCK, because she overlooked a tiny carrot icon in the upper left corner of the screen; I was shouting FOR her by the time she finally found the damn thing. Testers have lectured me on how the company ought to run things, and they harp on how shitty they’re being treated. I’ve even been accused of taking food out of their kids’ mouths.And most of the time, they’re not even wrong. I get where they’re coming from. I feel their pain.I have to soften the tones, avoid using certain clips, or maybe blip out bad words to keep stakeholders from getting defensive or casting the user aside — because they’re obviously an outlier. I end up swallowing down the hardest bits of feedback because they get in the way of the team taking action.It happens a few times a year: leadership doesn’t like the direction a design is going, or the product manager is skeptical that the most important element will be overlooked, or a hedge case someone didn’t think of brings a whole project to a screeching halt.People disagree, start picking fights, and obsess about all the little what-ifs until someone says, “let’s get some actual users to look at it.”Then they bring me in to scope out the project. I start to get a lay of the land.But when the tension becomes clear, I’ve got to set up side conversations and chat threads and email chains. I once was involved in a chain of emails that got so complicated that the boss’s boss’s boss had to tell everyone to stop replying to the thread and pick it up Monday. (I never thanked her for that. I really should.)I’ve learned to sniff out when research actually IS what will break the stalemate and get the ball rolling again. It’s nice when that happens. But that’s usually only about half the time.The other half of the time, I end up feeling caught between 2 parents who aren’t speaking to each other. I have to treat certain team members more carefully and layer in my extra-strength diplomacy skills to break the tension.I’ve had to learn how suppress the urge to roll my eyes and shout, “Why can’t we all just get along?!” Get ready for that.I did some testing for a fancy food delivery company — the kind of place where you might buy a big box of steaks and pre-made sides for Father’s Day or gourmet lava cakes for your sister’s birthday.Every tester got to checkout and immediately complained about the pop-up offer trying to upsell them on adding 1–2 more things to their cart. We pretty much all hate those things, they’re a pain in the ass.But when I reported it back to my stakeholders, they were basically like, “We know, we hear it all the time. But it works; people DO add more at the last minute and boost the average order value.”Cue my eye roll.It’s a fair point. We don’t just build what the end users want. We also have to consider what the business wants.Unfortunately, that means that UX researchers have to listen to the same complaint, again and again, with the knowledge that their complaints will never be addressed.At one job, we referred to these pain points as the “known knowns”. They had their own page in our internal web site.After a while, you go numb to it. You get tired of hearing it. You get frustrated with the fact that the pain points aren’t addressed. So you move on and find a new customer base. You last a couple of years before the same ol’ known knowns start showing up, and then you dust off the resume.Bottom line…I’m good at it.I’ve got a higher-than-average emotional intelligence score, so I’m good at reading people and responding accordingly. (Testers and stakeholders alike.)By extension, that means I have an easier time understanding my stakeholders and crafting stories and deliverables that meet them where they’re at.Not only am I good at connecting dots, but I genuinely enjoy doing it. There’s something deeply satisfying about staring hard at data and teasing the answers out of it. There’s something immensely gratifying when you see recommendations from your research show up in the product roadmap.My skills of diplomacy make it easier to manage stakeholders and tease out the underlying influences and impacts a project will have.And because of all of that stuff^, when I talk, people listen. I interviewed for a job a couple years ago, and after presenting some examples of my work, one of the interviewers told me, “You made me NOT want to multi-task!”It might be the best compliment I’ve ever received.Okay so look, if you’ve made it this far, there’s a good chance you’re an aspiring UX researcher. And if I haven’t frightened you off, GOOD. Go kick ass.If the reasons I like being a UX researcher don’t sound like you, NO WORRIES. There are lots of researchers out there that are awesome at their jobs and absolutely nothing like me. Go be one of those, and kick even MORE ass.And to all readers, I’d like to thank you for reading this unfiltered take on my work. I hope it’s been entertaining, and that I haven’t caused offense. You have my genuine apologies if I did. I promise to keep my diplomacy hat on for most of my other posts.Most, but not all. ;)"
To the Left of Normal,The Big Roundtable,"Jul 25, 2017",https://medium.com/thebigroundtable/to-the-left-of-normal-81f82918f088?source=home---------30------------------0----------,"The biggest lie about OCD is that it’s funnyBy Emily DixonAlex and I have OCD. We’re both twenty-four; he obsesses over the number three, and I obsess over the number four. His OCD is hand sanitizer, a rollercoaster, and a lifetime of going through the motions. Mine is Facebook and eyelashes and asking questions I’d give anything not to ask.“It’s something I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life,” says Alex. I underline this in my notebook.**Alex rode a rollercoaster in the fall — the Cyclone, on Coney Island. Until that day he knew for a fact he was afraid of heights, thanks to a panic attack on a Disney World ride years before. But after he was diagnosed with OCD at sixteen, he began to keep a journal. As he started to recover, he wrote down everything he knew about himself: his favorite season (winter), his favorite color (red), the bands that he liked, his biggest fears. And as his illness receded, he found that the answers changed. His preferred season became spring; his color of choice, yellow. And he realized that he wasn’t afraid of heights. Or of people, or of staying alive after all.A miserable prologue: That’s how Alex defines every moment before he broke down in his boarding school bedroom, crying and vomiting for two long days until the school doctor asked him the question he didn’t know he’d been waiting to answer: Do you think you might need help? Before his diagnosis, he believed he just wasn’t built to function in society. “It was a relief to know it had a name,” he said. “And that other people had it.”Alex’s existence was OCD. He divided the world into multiples of three. He touched objects three times, repeated mantras three times, recited lines from books three times. And then he obsessed, calling or texting his father, who is a doctor, several times an hour with fears about his health. There wasn’t space left in his brain for anything else. He didn’t have friendships. He didn’t have hobbies. He went through the motions for show — playing sports, excelling at school. “There was no real person doing those things,” he said. “I learned to act how a normal kid should, but it was all a façade.”The façade wasn’t entirely effective. Alex’s schoolmates didn’t realize he was ill, but they did realize something was off. “I was bullied for twitching, for being strange, for being a nerd, for being reclusive, for hanging round the teachers,” he said. “I was stuffed in a locker once.”After touching a door handle or shaking someone’s hand, Alex would hastily sanitize his hands with Purell. “I couldn’t focus until I’d done it,” he said. In the company of others, he’d try to suppress the urge for as long as possible, for fear of the mockery that would follow. “I would hold out as long as I could until my mind exploded.”He lived numbly. “It was a constant state of a really bad state,” he said. “There’d be objectively good days, where from the outside, you’d think good things were happening, but it wouldn’t even register with me.”The inevitable end, Alex believed, was suicide. He couldn’t foresee living past sixteen. He imagined his gears wearing out, his engine failing, with no spark of humanity inside to reanimate them. The only reason he didn’t try to kill himself was because he was too busy obsessing, counting over and over to three.Recovery, through cognitive behavioral therapy and medication, was slow and excruciating. “If I had a million and one worries and could knock it down to a million by the end of the week, that was the biggest achievement in the world,” he said. Even now, at twenty-four, he considers himself years behind his peers in terms of social development. He performs confidence, conceals his conviction that he’ll only wind up rejected, and hopes that one day it will become the default.His photographic memory pulls him back against his wishes. “At least a few times a day I’m reminded of a visual image and an emotion, and I won’t know why,” he says. He reminds himself that time has passed, that he no longer exists only to obsess. But he never feels the illness is truly behind him. “I can’t forget the past,” he says. “I can’t escape it.”**When I first spoke to Alex, over Facebook, he told me he wouldn’t want himself any other way. Initially, before I spoke to him in person, I struggled not to take this personally, having spent a lifetime praying indiscriminately to please, please, wake up any other way. When we met, I asked him to clarify. “As much as I say I wouldn’t change who I am,” he said, “I would certainly like to change the way I got here. But I’m proud of myself. And I’m thankful.”Whenever Alex concedes a negative, he sandwiches it within a positive. When I ask if he’s happy now, he says, “I’m a thousand times happier than I was,” before admitting that there’s something ineffable that’s missing, something he understands only by its absence. “But I’m closer than I’ve ever been!”He sees obsession as a spectrum, one on which he’ll always be “just to the left of normal.” And he pictures happiness, whatever that means, in his future. He imagines he’ll still be anxious when he gets there, but he’ll be a thousand miles away from his boarding school bedroom floor. He’d be grateful to stay exactly as anxious as he is today, in fact, providing his obsessions don’t accelerate again. “That’s the goal!” he says.Alex is kinder and braver than I am. I find it hard to be grateful for surviving for so long, so many times. Some days I’m so angry I feel it in the speed of my heartbeat: at the kids who bullied me in school, at the interminable waiting lists for therapy, at the friends who didn’t understand or never thought to ask. And at myself, most of all, for putting that look on my parents’ faces, over and over again. Describing that look is hard and hurts too much. It hurts more to imagine how it feels.**The biggest lie about OCD is that it’s funny, though it is, at times. I laughed when Alex explained why his compulsive blinking in multiples of three — sometimes spiraling up to nine, eighteen, twenty seven — stopped him getting anything done: “Because, well, my eyes were closed.” I laugh when I remember running for the school bus barefoot every morning, brandishing my shoes and socks to flag down the driver, because I had to button and unbutton my uniform so many times — in multiples of four — that I could never quite find the time to clothe my feet.Still, I never manage to laugh when someone tells me about their alphabetized bookshelf, and how they’re “just so OCD” about those books.The second biggest lie is that OCD is only about compulsions. Only rituals, continued indefinitely, like washing your hands or flicking a light switch on and off or, indeed, like blinking or buttoning and unbuttoning a shirt. The rituals, people know. The intrusive thoughts that motivate them, they consider less. They can’t conceive of primarily obsessional obsessive-compulsive disorder, where the worries never transmute into a physical compulsion but balloon instead inside the brain. Or of the false memory, the Frankenstein’s monster of an intrusive thought, one ruminated over so long that it solidifies into a grotesque imitation of the truth. Or of trichotillomania, the disorder so often co-morbid with OCD that compels me to pull out my hair.I started pulling my eyelashes and eyebrows when I was fourteen. At first I picked the mascara from my lashes, and then I plucked the lashes from the root. Before school, I smeared my mam’s brown eyeliner into the gap in my right eyebrow, though the result was too dark and too warm toned and looked like the handiwork of a child with a crayon. In my final year of university, I squinted into the mirror and extracted my last eyelash with blunt tweezers. For the next four months, I watched my human face return and the pink-eyed rat I’d created fade away.My friends and family wince when I pull out my lashes, telling me it looks disgusting, or it creeps them out, or my eyes look red and sore. It’s not out of malice — they know I want to stop, and so they try to make me. But deploying shame against obsessive-compulsive disorder is like spraying gasoline to quench a fire. I am ashamed with every eyelash I remove. I’ve been ashamed for longer than my memory can recount. The shame only incites me to hurt myself more.**I’ve written and rewritten my own history of OCD, in notebooks and diaries no one will ever read. Each account I’ve squirreled away, for fear it’s too self-involved or too angry or too melodramatic. I’ve been actively writing it since I was sixteen. It started playing out long before I knew it had a name.Alex says there were signs of anxiety when he was an infant. I remember insisting on a particular breakfast cereal when I was six, because I had a math test that day and I was afraid the Cheerios were unlucky.My OCD assumed a recognizable form the first time around. By the time I was fourteen I was touching every item in my bedroom, while repeating a nonsensical phrase before I could go to sleep or leave the house. I ate, showered, and slept according to strict patterns, all governed by the number four. In bed, I lay facing the wall, my legs curled in the fetal position, and was not permitted to roll over or stretch out or release my right arm from under the pillow. When I wrote or typed, each line had to contain an even number of words, and the first and last word of the line had to contain an even number of letters, and the first and last letter had to be an arbitrarily assigned “good” letter, like A or Q or X. I couldn’t wear new clothes or allow a new item into my bedroom. Instead, I balled them into plastic bags and hid them under my mam’s bed. We screamed at each other every time she found them, because I didn’t know how to explain.I ate exactly four Cheerios for breakfast. I tucked in every chair at the dining table four, sixteen, thirty-two times. I wore the same too-short school trousers every day, to the endless amusement of two snickering boys on my bus. I repeated every number I ever saw sixteen times. Before long, I could recite by heart the phone number from every real estate agent’s placard in my hometown.After a brief round of cognitive behavioral therapy, my OCD returned, newly metamorphosed. I became acutely paranoid, compelled to ask every classmate if they were talking about me — which pretty soon they were, because I was demonstrably mental. Two years after I left that school, a boy sent me a mocking Facebook message, telling me he’d heard someone talking about me on the bus. I deleted the message. Then deactivated my account. And then I cried.The third, and worst, iteration of my illness was primarily obsessional OCD, which bloomed like mold when I was twenty. My anxiety zeroed in on the Internet. I scoured Facebook for entire days, searching for half-remembered status updates that inexplicably made my brain itch. I messaged classmates I barely knew when we took math together, let alone six years later, and begged them to delete photos where I appeared only as a dim shape in the background. I lost friends because I couldn’t explain why I needed an ancient wall post gone — not to them or to myself. I felt as though something else was steering the ship; as though every day I woke up to a mind that was less and less my own.I feared, too, that I was a bad person, who might have hurt people like childhood bullies had once hurt me. I agonized over things I’d said, and how they could have been interpreted. On the worst days, I tortured myself over things I’d never said at all.On one metro journey into the center of town, a teenage girl sat down opposite me, and I noticed a small pink pimple bubbling on her right cheek, almost exactly mirroring the one on my left. The train pulled away from the station, but I felt another engine rumble into action. Imagine if you pointed it out, said my brain. Imagine if you laughed at her. Imagine if you called her ugly. Imagine if you stood up, and pointed at her, and called her ugly, and shouted it over and over and over until she cried. The topic exhausted, the train veered onto another track. What if you did call her ugly, and you’ve just forgotten? said my brain, thunderous even as I turned up the volume of my headphones, knowing already that it wouldn’t work. Are you sure you didn’t say anything? She looks sad. Are you sure you didn’t call her ugly? I got off the train three stops early and hyperventilated on the platform, pressing my hands into my temples as if to squeeze out the thoughts.Obsessive thoughts calcify. Played on repeat, they settle into the crevices of the mind, occupying space reserved for memories. The worst ones become impossible to distinguish from the truth. I truly believed that I’d stood on a train and screamed at a teenage girl with a pimple. I emailed a writer I’d never met, apologizing for something I knew I’d never said. Whenever a celebrity died, I knew that it was the result of something I did or said, and I’d just forgotten how exactly I was involved.I took a year out of university and spent it imploding. When I returned, I graduated thanks to two factors. The first was a medication and therapy combination that finally, impossibly, seemed to work. The second, the ceaseless tenacity of my mam, who took a four-hour train to Oxford every weekend just to make sure I was eating and leaving my bedroom. Shakily, I stepped onto an upward trajectory, one I still tentatively ascend today.Now, I have mostly good days, with some bad ones peppered in between. At the very least, I can feed myself and leave my house, though my mam’s now an entire ocean away.Neither Alex or I can declare with any certainty that we’ll ever know a life without OCD. But for now, we are alive. For now, that is enough.**Alex appears relaxed and self-assured, but as he speaks, he picks frantically at his right thumb with his forefinger. I turn to record it in my notebook and notice I am twisting my ribbon bookmark around my own right forefinger, so tightly that my fingertip is milk-white from lack of circulation. We both, it turns out, habitually contort our fingers without realizing. And I can’t sit down to a paper tablecloth or see a paper label on a water bottle without shredding it like a hamster. We’re not on the brink anymore, but neither of us is calm.I ask Alex the same question several times before I realize I’m prodding for an answer I’m not going to get. I want him to tell me it hurts him, too, to hear people use “OCD” as a stand-in for “meticulous.” He never does. “I know that they don’t mean offense,” he says. “It’s just ignorance.”Last year I worked in a bookshop, and spent a significant portion of my days shaping and reshaping stacks of new crime paperbacks into fastidiously themed pyramids. It was my job, not a compulsion. If I let the pyramids disintegrate, no one I loved would die. But the jokes came all the same. One customer sidled towards me, in search of the children’s department, as I aligned the books with the edge of the table. “Do you work here?” she opened, grinning. “Or do you just have OCD?”A careers advisor declared, after I explained why I took a year out of university, that she must have OCD as well, because she worries a lot. A professor told me she was OCD about sentence structure. When I was fifteen and still newly diagnosed, I waited until the classroom was empty and told my favorite teacher why I arranged the same paperback on top of the same planner on top of the same workbook on my desk in every class. In response, he pointed conspiratorially to a neat pile of papers. “See?” he said. “I’m OCD too!”I can’t hate anyone for making OCD jokes, partly because it’s an unfortunate part of our lexicon — whether I like it or not — and partly because I’d have to hate most of the people I know. And I worry that I’m oversensitive, and that the twist in my gut when I hear a person described as “psycho,” or the erratic city weather as “bipolar,” is just an overreaction. I’m tired of being angry. I’ve been angry for far too long.But still I wonder, if mental illness wasn’t so widely perceived as a joke, whether I would have taken so long to tell my parents I was faltering. Whether it would have been quite so easy for the kids at Alex’s school or mine to take the piss out of us. Or whether, after I told a doctor that I couldn’t survive in this mind any longer, he would have sent me away with a generic antidepressant prescription and a flippant comment about how long the waiting lists for therapy were. I saw him again the same week, in the hospital, after swallowing every pill he had prescribed for me.The paramedics who put me in an ambulance left a plastic thermometer cap in my university bedroom. I kept it there for weeks. Whenever the obsessive thoughts threatened to overwhelm me again, I touched it, and tried to remind myself that this was an illness. That medical professionals had been here, in my room. That the doctors and the medication were the truth, and the clamoring in my head was not. To me, one of the cruelest tricks of mental illness is its ability to convince the sufferer that it isn’t there at all.**Before my initial diagnosis, I had carried a wooden coffee stirrer from Starbucks in my coat pocket at all times. I knocked on wood compulsively, afraid that if I didn’t, simple statements of fact — “I have three siblings”; “I have two cats” — would become horribly and immediately untrue. Conversely, I couldn’t walk barefoot on a wooden floor, or touch paper with bare hands. I feared that by touching any derivative wood product, I’d actualize any negative thought that flitted through my mind. When writing in school, I rested my hand on a plastic ruler or the cuff of my sweater to avoid touching the workbook. “It’s because I’m left-handed,” I lied to curious classmates. “My hand will smudge the ink.”You learn to fight these things. Months after I began therapy, I practiced reciting sentences aloud while sitting on my hands. Exposure therapy, the psychologist explained. “I have a mam and a dad,” I said, resisting the twitch of my fingers towards the wooden window frame. “I have two brothers and a sister.” Next, I took off my socks and stood on the wooden floor. “I failed all my classes,” I said, “and my family are disappointed in me.” Unable to stand still, I paced in tight circles around my bedroom. “My family is dead. My family is dead. My family is dead.”Other compulsions were easier to rationalize away. Few would argue that any lives depended on my four morning Cheerios. Most would agree that I could roll over in bed without jeopardizing my future. The people around me knock on wood without a thought, barely even realizing that they do it. For them, the compulsion passes within seconds. For me, it grows roots.In every coffee shop I enter, I look at the stirrers for a second too long. Carrying one would be easier, I think, than rummaging through my makeup bag for an eye pencil, smearing the color on my hands as I touch the sliver of exposed wood at the tip. It would be less conspicuous than lunging toward the first tree I spot on the sidewalk. But it’s important to resist, I remind myself. And I have, so far.Still, I’m typing this with my forearms primly elevated. My desk is wooden. I can’t let my elbows touch.Emily Dixon is a post-graduate Fellow in Narrative Nonfiction at the Columbia Journalism School. You can follow her at @emilyldxn"

The Three Tech Projects You Meet in Hell,Timothy,Oct 19,https://medium.com/@arthegall/the-three-tech-projects-you-meet-in-hell-2e529132ab3a?source=home---------109------------------0----------,"If you’ve read even a children’s book about Greek mythology, one thing that will stand out is how often the Greek gods punished people. Whether you were mortal or immortal, if you broke a promise or snubbed a guest or showed even the smallest amount of hubris in front of an Olympian, you could end up spending eternity as a spider, or tied to a flaming wheel, or as a frustrated futurist.Of course, ancient myth isn’t just an easy source of bedtime stories for 21st century children (another: a good translation of Grimm). It also can work for us the same way it worked for the ancient Greeks themselves: a reasonable store of metaphor, archetypes, and shorthand for people or situations we meet or know in every day life.Three of the most famous, and vivid, punishment myths are the myths of Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Prometheus.It occurred to me recently — during a conversation with a coworker, another software engineer at an ‘enterprise’ (i.e. large) company — that while we always want to see ourselves directly in the roles of mythical characters, these three myths actually function as good metaphors for different kinds of technical teams we are likely to encounter during a career.I’m not talking about successful teams here! These are punishment myths, and so the kind of team or project that I’d like to describe are failing or broken.I’ll argue that there are three kinds of Broken Team or Failing Project, which we can describe as(I’ll use “Team” and “Project” nearly interchangeably for the rest of this post.)Knowing what kind of team you’re in — or maybe what kind of team you’re dealing with from the outside — might be helpful in understanding how to talk to the people in it, predicting how it will (nearly inevitably) end, and perhaps softening the blow for those involved with it when it does.Each kind of team I’m describing differs in the way it’s perceived from the inside of the team (by members of the team or project, or close coworkers) vs the outside of the team (usually “management”).We sometimes find Sisyphus teams in organizations where groups of engineers are allocated (sometimes in a “matrix”) across multiple products or projects. Each product team conducts meetings, does planning, closes tickets, executes releases — and yet the team itself is unmoored from the users who do (or don’t) use their software, and “floats” in a state of keeping-the-lights-on water-treading for years at a time. A manager might look at project planning software and see that “we have 15% of engineer A and 23% of engineer B allocated to the team,” but … nothing is really happening.So a Sisyphus team, from the outside, looks like it’s making progress. Engineers are assigned, tickets are being closed, code is committed, the rock is being rolled up that hill! Sure, there might be occasional setbacks or problems, but the team is functioning and day-to-day or week-to-week there are incremental improvements.From the inside, however, a Sisyphus team’s difficulty in reaching its goals — its futility and absurdity — are immediately apparent. This is not to say that the members of the team are necessarily frustrated. They might be unhappy, but sometimes they have come to grips with the absurdity of their own situation and the consequent freedom bought by that realization.Tantalus teams are, if anything, the mirror image of Sisyphus teams.From inside, the team always appears about to reach its goals. Project completion, or the next release, is always close. People in the team are hungry, motivated… and it’s only from the outside that perhaps we can see how the deadlines are always receding, the “killer” feature always delayed, the important customer always a little unsatisfied.Examples of a Tantalus team might be a team that’s trying to build, internally, a product or migration that will solve all our problems. Perhaps this team uses words like platform or framework to describe their end goal. It’s the last heist before retirement, or the “MVP” that doesn’t turn out to be so “minimal.”But however you describe it, the work is always in the present while the rewards continue to hover in the future.Another dividing line between Sisyphus and Tantalus teams is understanding how they end. How does an organization bring itself to a point where it can shut down a Broken Team, or end a Failed Project?Each of these teams is broken through the way that the inside and outside views of the team are so different, and so any resolution will necessary also involve re-aligning these two viewpoints.The distinction between inside and outside perceptions of a team points us towards one answer: Sisyphus teams are ended through ground-up communication, while Tantalus teams must be shut down by management.In the case of a Sisyphus team, change has to come from team level up to management, about the state of the project, its lack of progress, and the futility and frustration that results from continued work.Conversely, in a Tantalus team, you can’t make progress by talking to the team members. Here, each person working on the project still believes that they’re always almost about to reach their goal! It’s the responsibility of the gods, the Olympian C-Suite or upper management, to realize that Tantalus is grasping at but never reaching its own goals.The alternative to successfully shutting down a Sisyphus or Tantalus team is that it becomes the third kind of failure: a Prometheus team.Prometheus had perhaps the most straightforward punishment. There’s no difference-of-opinion about what is happening to him: he’s getting his liver eaten. He knows, the vultures who eat it know, the gods know. Everyone knows, and yet the punishment continues.Maybe you’ve encountered this kind of project in your own career. Perhaps it’s a piece of critical infrastructure which only one engineer knows how to maintain and therefore can never escape. Or it might be an application, so crusted over with technical debt and unused code that updating or releasing it is impossible, but which has a user group powerful enough to prevent any tech retirement or migration.This is the third kind of Broken Team: a team which is clearly dysfunctional, yet no one involved has the will or power to fix. From management who fund its, to the leaders who run it, and even the engineers who are tormented by it daily, everyone knows it’s broken but we are hopelessly chained to the rock.You’ll sometimes hear engineers involved in startups or small companies claim that the biggest mistake is building the wrong software, that “knowing what to build” is the most important thing.In a large company, by contrast, “knowing what teams to shut down” is one of the most important decisions an organization can make. The alternative is broken teams which continue to push on for years at a time, always almost successful, or forever pushing the tickets up the hill while watching new ones slide back down to the bottom.When you find (or find yourself in) a Sisyphus or Tantalus team, you also have a decent guess as to what kind of feedback is needed — and from whom — before the team can be shut down. Even Prometheus was eventually rescued from his rock.Don’t let your teams become Prometheus Teams! If you’re a manager, find your Tantalus projects. If you’re an engineer in a Sisyphus team, speak up! Prometheus may be objectively the best Titan (insert [fire emoji] [human emoji] here) but no one deserves that kind of punishment."
Living Boundaries,Ryder Carroll,Nov 3,https://rydercarroll.medium.com/living-boundaries-5b81f6a635?source=home---------57------------------0----------,"In this series we’ve explored different ways to set personal boundaries. As critical as setting boundaries may be, it’s what happens after we set them that determines their usefulness.Maintaining personal boundaries is a life-long process. There are two ways we can approach this process. These two ways are best exemplified by two diverging ways sacred buildings were constructed in the east vs the west. It all boils down to a philosophy of time.Japan is home to some of the most well preserved temples in the world. Where brick and stone ruins litter much of Europe, these wooden buildings endure. Some are more than 1000 years old. Why? Whereas European buildings were often built to resist the forces of nature, Japanese temples were built to embrace them.Many of these wooden Japanese temples and shrines use no nails. This makes it possible to disassemble and reassemble the building. It also makes it a lot easier to replace parts as they inevitably succumb to the seasons. When a piece starts to warp, crack, or rot, they can simply replace it with relative ease.This forward-looking philosophy was also embodied by the resident monks who plant the trees used for the repairs. They plant trees they know will be harvested in future seasons they won’t live to see.Life, like nature, is continually shifting through seasons. Each season brings with it different conditions. As conditions change, so do we, so do our needs. Parts of us are always growing, rotting, blooming, and sometimes in dire need of replacement.Our boundaries are often created in response to specific external conditions. Maybe it was because a person or a situation is causing us a lot of distress. It worked. The problem is, time moved on. Some boundaries can persist long after our circumstances have changed. This is how the boundaries we have often differ from the ones we need.Boundaries that served to protect us in one season of our life, can limit, blind, or even damage us in another. For example, the personal boundaries that protected you from a toxic boss, now cost you tremendous growth opportunities with your new nurturing boss. Or, necessary boundaries set with your last relationship now jeopardize your ability to connect with a new partner.It’s important to keep in mind that it’s not only our seasons that are ever changing, so are everyone else’s. The needs of everyone we know — even those we are most intimately familiar with — are not static. Where boundaries were unnecessary at one point in a familiar relationship, they may become necessary later on.For example, new therapists have a tendency to use their partners as guinea pigs, trying out tools they just learned to “help” their unwilling partner. Or your work friend becomes your boss, and starts leaning on your freindship to guilt you into doing more work.Conditions are always changing, and so must our boundaries. Outdated boundaries can quickly become barriers, trapping us in a past that prevents us from fully engaging with the present.Personal boundaries are ideas about what is and is not acceptable to us. These opinions are formed based on how we judge personal experiences: This felt good. This did not. It is a judgment formed at a moment in time.Each of our boundaries are artifacts of our experiences. Artifact by artifact, we start to build the outline of our comfort zone. This is where we go to avoid pain. This is where we feel safe. The problem is that there is no growth without making ourselves vulnerable, without lowering barriers we’ve spent much of our life erecting to protect ourselves.Personal growth happens almost exclusively outside of our comfort zone, where we are likely to experience pain. The process of persevering despite this pain is what develops our skill, bravery, confidence, our character. It shows us what we’re capable of, replacing fear with a sense of great possibility.Persistence in the face of struggle is how we grow. On the other had, experiencing persistant pain in our lives often indicates the lack of boundaries, which tends to stunt our growth. How do we reconcile the two?The trick is understanding which boundaries are relevant.I believe that boundaries are a set of conditions that we put in place to allow us show up for others and ourselves. We limit access to some, to be more present with our family. We don’t talk about a topic with a loved family member, because that topic drives us apart. If the circumstances that require our boundaries are present, then chances are our boundaries are relevant.Boundaries that don’t actively help us show up are barriers. They may have kept you safe in the past, but now are trapping you there. They’ve now likely become barriers separating you from being the version of yourself you want to be. Common examples include: being distrustful, being quiet, being distant, being unemotional, being agreeable, being safe, avoiding opportunities.Like with the temple, we need to continually remove the rotting pieces that no longer support us, and replace them with ones that do. In order to do that, we need rituals.Healthy boundaries are alive. Like all living things, they need to be maintained. I tend to my boundaries through rituals. Simply put, these rituals are regular checkins to examine sources of discomfort in my life.My rituals are simple. I schedule time each week and month to look for sources of discomfort in my life. I do this by reviewing my calendar and journal, asking myself some questions, and then journaling about what comes up. Let’s break that down.I use my calendar and journal to remind myself of what I’ve experienced in the past week, or month. I think about those experiences, and see what comes up. Something usually will trigger a sense of discomfort, the question is: is this a singular event or part of a larger pattern?Discomfort can take many forms. Sometimes that discomfort is valuable, often it’s unnecessary. Questions can help me determine the value of my discomfort and if it’s a pattern. Here are some of the questions I ask myself:Would I do this again? Is this a pattern?What am I worried about?What am I stressed about?What am I scared of?What am I tolerating?What am I angry about?What is draining my energy?Next, I write about what comes up. If I’m worried about something, I try to see if there is anything within my control that I can do to reduce my worry. Sometime there isn’t, sometimes there is.When it comes to a pattern of discomfort, one of the only things in my control is to set a boundary. If I’m worried about my health, I have to set work boundaries by communicating with my team. This creates the conditions for rest.If I’m tolerating someone’s poor quality work, I will create a new agreement that clearly states what I will and will not tolerate in order to keep working together. They will either deliver or they won’t. Either way, I will no longer have to tolerate the quality of work.The trick to all of this is consistency. Regularly checking in with ourselves, helps us remain mindful of what is and is not acceptable in our lives. Knowing what is unacceptable helps us create boundaries and a clear vision of what needs to be done now. In some seasons that means replacing pieces of our life that no longer support us. In others, it’s adding entirely new structures to support the growing life we’re now capable of creating."

Manifesto for the Data-Informed,Julie Zhuo,Nov 4,https://joulee.medium.com/the-data-informed-manifesto-9dd8c240382f?source=home---------52------------------0----------,"Why is the promise of big data so much better than the reality?Data has been extolled as the vanquisher of uncertainty, the harbinger of a robotic future, a necessity in every role from product management to engineering, sales to design.Yet many of us who have tried to use data to inform decisions in organizations have experienced a different reality. One where we are constantly confused by how metrics are defined, bicker over how to interpret various analyses, and struggle to apply the insights into action.It’s because building a data-informed culture is hard. Logging user actions, creating dashboards, running A/B tests, and shipping ML models — these are useful. But they are not the foundation of being data-informed.We believe that being data-informed comes down to internalizing a set of values. These are simple, few, yet exceedingly powerful:The first step to being data-informed is understanding what data can’t do: give you a purpose.Data does not substitute for a mission or a strategy. It cannot uncover a set of values. Metrics are merely proxies for what matters. “Increasing Metric X” is not a purpose; a true purpose must relate in some way to creating value for other humans. If a data-informed team feels at any point like they are optimizing metrics in a way that compromises their mission, they scrap that work.Before you can collect data to help you track what matters, you need to define what actually matters. Information itself is not an evaluation criteria.How will you know if you are fulfilling your mission? You imagine outcomes that build towards the future you envision. Then you set goals to help you verify whether you are achieving those outcomes.Vague goals that are difficult to verify aren’t useful and create confusion within a team. We want to make our users happier. We want to make the world safer. We want people to be more productive. These don’t give you an objective baseline to evaluate different strategies or tactics. And you won’t know whether you’ve achieved them.Data-informed teams push for quantitative goals to the greatest extent possible because they’re the best way for a team to focus on creating impact. They make progress transparent, force accountability, and rally your team around a shared outcome.Goal-setting is more art than science. All metrics are proxies and every set of verifiable goals will have shortcomings in what they fail to capture. As you learn those shortcomings, you will iteratively refine your methods of measurement and your targets. Setting goals is a skill — you have to practice it to get better.Data-informed teams adopt verifiable goals to drive impact while acknowledging these imperfections. They recognize that goals serve the team in their march toward the mission, never the other way around.Everyone has to know the numbers. You cannot outsource a data-informed culture.You can have the best team of analysts — but if you don’t know the numbers, then your decision-making will suffer.Data-informed teams regularly meet to review key metrics. Why? Decisions are never made in these meetings, so why have them at all?These meetings signal something important about the culture — that simply knowing and talking about the key metrics matters. Doing so builds a shared foundation among a team of what is going well or not well, and how they might best prioritize efforts.Good data-informed teams develop leaders who can weave data into clear narratives. These teams cultivate a skilled understanding of which data patterns are important and which ones are not. They point out conflicts in data and which interpretation is more likely. Most importantly, they are upfront about what the data can and cannot say.We all have hypotheses about what our customers care about, what products will win, and what decisions are best. The more experienced we become, the more we trust — and even pride ourselves on — our intuition.A well-honed intuition about which path to take is supremely valuable because we don’t have infinite time and resources to try every path.The danger comes when your pride in your intuition leads you to close yourself off to evidence that you might be wrong. Instead of testing your intuition with data, you seek out data that confirms your intuition.Openness to being proven wrong is insufficient. Data-informed teams actively seek out information that might disconfirm their assumptions. They value a high velocity of experimentation and setting hold-outs. Like scientists, they are constantly looking to test their hypotheses and validate their beliefs. They don’t view intuition versus data as a forced choice — they use data to refine their intuition over time.Members of data-informed teams regularly ask each other: “What evidence would convince you that your intuition is wrong?” If the honest answer is “No piece of data would convince me,” then you have strayed off of the data-informed path.Data will never give you certainty. Interpreting data means taking on many assumptions that are reasonable but not bulletproof. Even trusting a single piece of analysis means having faith that the events were logged correctly, that the metrics have been calculated without error, that everyone understands exactly what was logged and calculated, and that the interpretation is sound. You want to be 100% sure? Good luck.People who are not truth-seekers constantly take advantage of this. The easiest way to discredit data is to demand perfection from it.When data and intuition collide, some people always pick their intuition. They would rather be wrong betting on their intuition than wrong betting on data (this is rampant in the world of sports). That is a defeatist mindset. Your commitment to your mission requires that you make good decisions fast. Sometimes you will trust the data and you will be wrong. But if using data increases the likelihood of making the right call by 5–10%, those benefits will quickly compound.This is the promise of data — to help us gain an edge in our quest to build wonderful things for other humans.We are committed to promoting data-informed values, beliefs, and practices, and are looking for like-minded people interested in sharing their input on how to best tell this story.Drop us a note to join our community at datainformed@sundial.so.This piece was co-authored by Stanley Watt, Ani Prabhu, and Prasad Chakka."
How to Think About Your Career,Julie Zhuo,"Jul 26, 2016",https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-think-about-your-career-abf5300eba08?source=home---------40------------------0----------,"If you had asked 22-year-old me what my “career aspirations” were, I would have looked at you blankly and then casually changed the subject to what programs you’d recommend to model cute 3D bunnies for a video game, or whether the writers of Alias would be so devious as to ship Sydney Bristow and Sark.

It’s not that I didn’t think about my career at all. I was ambitious — I wanted to be a part of something big. I wanted to be able to support myself financially and not worry my parents (as this was a high bar set at doctor, aka the “stablest of all professions,” I suspect they still secretly worry about this.) I wanted the kind of job where I wouldn’t be watching the clock every hour, daydreaming like Rebecca Black about Friday.But beyond that, the specifics of “thinking about my career” was a giant grey cloud to me. It felt almost icky to be too career-oriented, like if you were, you were that kind of self-absorbed person constantly trying to game the system by sugar-coating the things you said to your bosses. Besides, at 22, I had taken my first job at a start-up where we were moving way too fast to sit down and idly contemplate the skills we hoped to learn. Who needs career conversations when you’re busy changing the world?Here’s the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not. If you don’t think about it, then you’re putting faith in the winds. Maybe you’ll end up somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Maybe not. Why take that chance when you can captain your own sails?Here’s what I wish I had known about getting a handle on my career earlier in life:It’s common to think of your career as your level within the company, or how much money you make, or your title, or whether you were included in some prestigious group (a meeting of importance, an exclusive conference, a list of N under N, an award recipient, etc.)Often, I hear people say things like, “I’m interested in advancing my career. What do I need to do to get promoted?”This is a perfectly valid question to ask, but I suspect what lurks beneath the question is the assumption that advancing one’s career = getting a promotion. I contest this quite heavily. In my opinion, it’s like equating being a good friend with getting invited to friend’s wedding.Certainly, the people who attend someone’s wedding are likely to be good friends. But you wouldn’t think that optimizing for getting an invitation to a wedding is the right way to go about being a good friend. In fact, it’s entirely the other way around. If you focus 100% on being a great friend to someone, even if you never once thought about being invited to their wedding, guess what. You’re probably going to get that fancy envelope in the mail.The same is true regarding your career. If you focus exclusively on improving your skills and your impact to your organization (or to the world at large), the promotions, raises and accolades tend to come as a byproduct.The reverse isn’t true. As an extreme analogy, you might have a terrible boss who tells you the way to get a promotion is to shut your mouth, fetch her coffee every morning, and do any busywork she assigns you. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Cool. But would doing this actually help you in the long run? Would doing this teach you new skills and make you a more attractive hire for some other company down the line? Probably not. Maybe what happens is that you rise in the ranks of that company only to have it go bankrupt later on. (Hey, this isn’t unreasonable given the organization seems to possess questionable management practices). Post-bankruptcy, you realize you don’t have many marketable skills in this rapidly-changing economy, so it’s hard to get a job at a similar comfort level to what you had. Life sucks. You get bitter.So don’t ask “What does it take to get a promotion?” Ask instead: “How can I be doing more to help make our customers (or would-be customers) happy?” Ask “What skills should I be developing to help me increase my impact?”Even if your current company has a broken promotion system, even if your company collapses tomorrow due to the winds of ill fortune, even if every external measure you hold yourself to — title, salary, affiliation, awards — goes out the window, your skills are forever. Nobody can take those away from you. No matter where you journey, your skills and your past experiences go along for the ride. This is why you shouldn’t worry too much if your career doesn’t follow some up-and-up external ladder structure. Are there instances where a new role with a pay cut and a title downgrade might unlock a treasure trove of new learnings and opportunities? Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? Just ask Sheryl Sandberg.Careers are long, so invest into them where it counts.For most of my career, I had the mental model that my manager, like my teachers and professors of the past, was someone in a position of authority who took note of what I did and passed judgement on it. They determined whether I was or wasn’t doing well, what I needed more critical feedback on, and what letter grade or assessment I deserved.As such, my modus operandi for interacting with my manager could be summarized in one neat statement: don’t come across as an idiot.This meant that I’d try and act as if I had my shit together in front of him or her. I’d exude confidence and optimism, even when I wasn’t feeling it. I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. There was no clearer evidence of personal failure than if my manager had to get involved in something I was responsible for. I read it as a neon sign brightly flashing Warning: employee not competent enough to take care of this task on her own.It wasn’t until I had managed for many years myself that this mindset began to change.Look, your manager’s job (assuming she is a good manager) is to help you and the rest of your team get better results. From this perspective, it is completely logical that she should be invested in your career. When you do better, then by extension, she does better. Hence, your manager is someone who is on your side, who wants you to succeed, and who is willing to spend a good deal of time and energy to help you do that.Can you imagine a star athlete trying to hide their weaknesses in front of their coach? Would you tell your personal trainer, “Oh, I’m pretty fit, I’ve got it under control” when she asks you how she can help you achieve a better workout? Of course not. That is not how a coaching relationship works.It’s precisely because I didn’t see my manager as a coach that I missed out on years of asking for and receiving training and feedback that would have helped me become better faster. Yes, of course, your manager still plays the role of judge. Yes, she can (and should) fire you if you can’t do the job, or do nothing but play Pokemon Go all day. But assuming you’re not unqualified or lazy or an asshole (and trust me, if you were, you’d know quite quickly), then your manager would like nothing better than for your career to be on a rocket-ship trajectory to the moon.You don’t just need coaching when you’re struggling. I’m willing to bet that everyone who’ll take home gold at Rio will have a coach. A majority of them will probably credit good coaching as a critical factor in getting them to where they are.The more honest you can be with your manager about your aspirations, your motivations, and where you’d like their help to improve, the faster you’ll move.A few years back, I wrote about a little book that caught my eye at Safeway, an obnoxious little thing with faux wax seal, quill-pen script, the ancient parchment paper glowing as if with magical beams. The book loudly proclaimed: Get whatever you want. Discover the secret to life.Spoiler warning ahead, but this is what the secret to getting whatever you want turned out to be: if you believe it can happen, it will happen.(I know, I know. I too was hoping it would be something more along the lines of Burn a sprig of Douglas Fir at 11:23pm on the eve of the New Moon and bow three times to a fat armadillo.)As trivial as the new-age tidbit of if you can believe it can happen, it will happen sounds, there is research that shows if you can create a clear visualization of yourself achieving the outcome you want, you prime yourself to act in a way that is consistent with what you imagine.Many years ago, when I was frustrated by all the things I struggled with and felt unequipped or scared to do in my job, I started a list of what I wished a future me would one day be able to waltz in and easily accomplish. This list is titled One Day, I will…Now, maybe seven or eight years later, this list is still up-to-date. I’ve added additional items throughout the years, but the more incredible thing is how I’ve been able to check things off. The skills that once seemed a distant dream when I was 25 or 26 now feel like second nature. And these proof points give me confidence that all the new items I am still adding will also happen. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.Going back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. These things I can clearly visualize are totally doable. So do them I will.If you’re curious what my list looks like, here is a snippet of items checked off through the years, and items that I am still working on:One Day, I will……✓ Not feel intimidated when I interview someone because I’m worried about what they think of me as an interviewer.✓ Not be nervous about a public speaking event in the days before it happens.✓ Feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting of > 5.✓ Publicly blog without stressing about what other people will think.Succinctly and clearly be able to make the point I want to make in 3 bullets.Regularly be able to weave compelling stories and analogies into verbal explanations.Host large events where people have fun and I am not really stressed out.…This is the last takeaway because no matter how many people are on the sidelines helping you, ignoring you, or working against you, your career — like your life — is your responsibility. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want. All of these things are in your power to affect or change.If you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why.If you look back on your last six months and you can’t point to anything that’s been hard for you, question whether you are challenging yourself enough.If you find yourself constantly looking for other people to tell you how awesome you’re doing, consider if you’re shortchanging your own growth and development.If your manager is not giving you the support or coaching you’d like, tell her how you’d like to be supported or coached.If working at your current company is not aligned with your long-term goals or values, consider making a move.If you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.No matter which way the wind blows, I hope you make it to beautiful shores.Interested in asking a question or following along for more advice?

Finding My Fighting Words: How I Learned to Have Uncomfortable Conversations,Daniel Shiner,"May 4, 2020",https://humanparts.medium.com/finding-my-fighting-words-how-i-learned-to-have-uncomfortable-conversations-9c0bb09c50c?source=home---------45------------------0----------,"I’
m sitting alone in a coffee shop in Manhattan and I’m about to become the most disliked person in the room. First, I’m going to interrupt the man reading quietly near the window and ask for a sip of his latte. Next, I’m going to ask the line of people waiting to pay if I can cut to the front of the queue. And before I do any of this, I am going to lie down on the dusty, coffee-stained floor — eyes open, slowly counting from one to 20 — as the rest of the room looks on in uncomfortable, visible disapproval. This is how I chose to spend my last vacation. Here’s why.Growing up, all I ever heard about was “EQ.” It was the mid-’90s, and psychologist Daniel Goleman had just popularized the concept of emotional intelligence with his 1995 bestseller of the same name. Now emotional quotient, or EQ, was becoming the latest buzzword to describe this new form of smarts. Unlike IQ, which tracked conventional measures of intelligence like reasoning and recall, EQ measured the ability to understand other people — to listen, to empathize, to self-regulate, and to appreciate. My mother, an elementary school principal, prized brains and hard work, but she placed a special emphasis on Goleman’s new idea. To her, EQ was what separated the good students from the great after they left the halls of her school. It was the elixir that transformed ideas and intellect into impact and influence. She was determined to send my sister and I into the adult world with as much of this elixir as possible, and she led regular dinner table conversations on the subjects of empathy, communication, and patience to do so.But when I finally began my first full-time job after graduation — an early employee at a fledgling tech startup — something was missing. Sure, EQ mattered: It was crucial in clinching the interview and integrating quickly into a small, tightly knit team. But before long, I began to notice a second elixir swirling around in the back pockets of some of my colleagues. It gave their opinions extra weight and their decisions added impact. It propelled them into positions of credibility and authority. Strangest of all, it seemed like the anti-EQ: Instead of knowing how to make others feel good, this elixir gave people the courage to do the opposite — that is, to say things that others did not want to hear.This was assertiveness. Psychologists conventionally define assertiveness as the healthy middle ground between passivity and aggressiveness, but in practice, I found that it boiled down to the mastery of a single skill: the ability to have uncomfortable conversations. Assertive people — those with high “AQ” — can comfortably engage in the sorts of conversations that make many of us squirm. They ask for things they want, decline things they don’t, provide constructive feedback, and engage in direct confrontation and debate. While the top performers at our company varied widely in terms of personality, gender, and introversion/extroversion, they all excelled at these types of tough talks.In fact, the more time I spent in the working world, the more I felt I could map everyone I interacted with according to their levels of EQ and AQ.Those with low EQ and low AQ were the “grumblers.” Difficult to work with and unable to speak up for themselves, grumblers turned to gossip and passive aggression to deal with others. Creating a toxic environment wherever they went, they generally encountered a low ceiling in their personal and professional lives.Those with high EQ but low AQ were the “people pleasers.” While well-liked and collaborative, people pleasers struggled with conflict and saying no to others. Like the grumblers, they also hit a ceiling, passed over by managers and steamrolled by friends and family for not having the guts to have tough conversations.Those with low EQ but high AQ were the “assholes.” Blissfully unaware of or uninterested in social graces, assholes ruthlessly told you what they thought without fear of or concern for how it made you feel. Assholes could sometimes buck the EQ trend and rise remarkably high on their AQ alone, but most eventually hit a ceiling, albeit a higher one. Peers whispered that they were hard to work with, and they were excluded from the best professional opportunities and personal relationships.Those with high EQ and high AQ were the “respected leaders.” These people were likable and great to work with, but also knew how to say no, ask hard questions, and share constructive feedback—and to do so in a way that was firm and respectful. This is where most of us want to be.Turning the mirror on myself, I landed in the top-right quadrant, but just barely. A lifetime honing my EQ helped me empathize with those around me, but it also left me overly sensitive to situations where I had to say or do things that might make others unhappy. While I didn’t avoid conflict, I was always frustrated by how much my mental machinery would degrade when I had to say or do something that could upset someone. Engaging in heated debates and providing negative feedback were the hardest for me. My thinking would get cloudy. I’d stumble through my words or use too many of them. After the conversation was over, I’d be frustrated by how poorly I had conveyed my message and feel emotionally drained from the experience. Compare that with the people I respected the most — our CEO, say, or my mother — who seemed to be able to maintain clarity of thought and speech in even the most uncomfortable situations.And there was another thing that kept me low on the AQ spectrum. Somewhere in my twenties, I’d lost track of my own introverted tendencies and let them snowball into moderate social anxiety, specifically when it came to approaching strangers. It felt like another unintended consequence of doubling down on EQ. Anytime I had to approach someone I didn’t know — at a trade show, networking event, or social occasion — my empathy would kick into a sort of broken, distorted overdrive. I’d instinctively imagine the person I wanted to speak to being annoyed or uncomfortable with my overture, feel a spike of anxiety at this imagined reaction, and more often than not, I’d bail. It felt like a dirty secret: I regularly spoke at conferences in front of hundreds of people, but I’d break into a sweat if I had to approach a single person in the crowd.This was a problem. Whether negotiating for a car or for venture capital, providing honest feedback to a romantic partner or a business partner, I knew that a stronger stomach for uncomfortable conversations would be necessary to get the things I wanted out of life. I became fixated on finding a way to move up the AQ spectrum.EQ is notoriously hard to improve. Socializing is a complex symphony of subtle cues and interactions, and getting better means learning to play an ensemble of new social instruments, often all at once. In contrast, improving my AQ felt like a much more manageable task. Instead of an orchestra, assertiveness felt like a single important, imposing instrument: the courage to tell people things they may not want to hear. This was good — I figured if I could just improve on this one skill, I could knock my AQ up a few notches.The problem was that meaningful improvement of any skill requires deliberate practice, the intensive form of practice coined by K. Anders Ericsson, the grandfather of expert performance psychology. Deliberately practicing a skill means setting a target just outside your comfort zone, crafting exercises that enable you to work repeatedly toward that target with intense concentration, and then, once you achieve it, raising the bar and repeating the process. A tennis player working on their backhand does not casually play games with friends, hoping to improve; they set a target, load the ball machine, and work the backhand — focusing intensely on every swing, observing the output, and adjusting their technique as they go.But there was no obvious ball machine for uncomfortable conversations. Providing friends or family with unsolicited “feedback” might be a fast way to practice, but I’d likely be left with no one to share my findings with once it was over. Waiting for real conversations to emerge organically was an option, but I reckoned that I only had about 10 really hard ones a year. Worse, most of these conversations snuck up on me, with no time to prepare beforehand or reflect meaningfully afterward. This left me with perhaps two or three opportunities a year to really focus and deliberately practice the skill. At that rate, by the time I got in the 40 or 50 reps I thought I’d need to make a meaningful improvement, some of the best years of my life would be over.This was when my gears started to turn. Could I build a ball machine for uncomfortable conversations? Could I create exercises — more realistic than role playing but safer than experimenting with real relationships — that simulated the key skills I wanted to develop? And could I wrap these exercises into a sort of personal bootcamp, which concentrated lots of practice into a short period of time, in order to accelerate my progress?I set out to create a bootcamp for uncomfortable conversations. Here’s how I did it:I created two types of exercises to develop my AQ: uncomfortable negotiations and unusual conversations.Uncomfortable negotiations involved entering into negotiations at flea markets, where I would offer vendors unreasonably low prices for their wares — generally 25% or less of the retail price. The negotiations would follow a specific script, where I had to make the offer and then remain silent, maintaining eye contact until they replied. If they declined, I had to firmly repeat my offer, followed by the same silent stare. If they declined a second time, I thanked them politely and went on my way. The goal was not to get a discount but to practice saying things to people that I knew they would not want to hear. This worked, sometimes too well: since the crafts on sale were often painstakingly produced by the people I was negotiating with, my lowball offers did not just discount the price — they discounted the creative output of the vendors themselves. As a result, my negotiation partners were not just disinterested in my offers, but often visibly insulted by them.Unusual conversations involved approaching strangers and saying or doing things that, while unthreatening, were downright weird. I began with easier challenges — asking someone on the street if they had a stick of gum or if they liked my shoes — and increased the intensity of the weirdness over time. By the last day, I had to ask a stranger for a sip of their drink, convince a tourist in the park that I knew them, and ask a line of people at a Starbucks to cut to the front without justification.¹The intent was two-fold: First, I hoped that by approaching strangers with highly uncomfortable requests, it would stretch my comfort zone, making more conventional approaches feel less daunting by comparison. Second, I guessed that the ability to take social risks — to be okay with other people thinking I was a bit weird — might be a prerequisite for the ability to tell people things they may not want to hear. If I were right, increasing my social risk tolerance would act like a rising tide, lifting all my other assertiveness ships along with it.I created 25 variations of each exercise, or 50 in total.² If I was averaging two or three opportunities for deliberately practicing uncomfortable conversations in the course of my normal life, I figured this would amount to about 25 years of life experience.I knew that doing these exercises would be scary and hard, so I leaned on a trick I learned from Cal Newport — the “grand gesture.” The idea is to tie a hard thing you’ve been meaning to do to something significant that breaks you out of your normal routine. J.K. Rowling booked stays in the Balmoral Hotel for $1,000 a night to help her complete the final book in the Harry Potter series. Bill Gates took “think weeks” at a cabin in the countryside to undertake deep thinking, away from the draws and distractions of everyday life.I took a week off work and flew from my home in Toronto to an Airbnb in East Harlem, a neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. Committing a nontrivial amount of time and money to the trip, combined with the reassurance that nobody there knew me, gave me the extra boost of intention to overcome the fear and complete the exercises. It also allowed me to structure the exercises as a bootcamp, so I could accumulate my 25 years of practice in only seven days.Fear loves discretion. En route to social events, I’d often promised myself to step out of my comfort zone and talk to strangers. But “talk to strangers” is a vague goal — Who is a stranger? How much talking do I have to do? — and given this wiggle room, my anxious brain would expertly craft credible reasons for why approaching people was impossible, or irresponsible, or a bad idea, and I’d bail.But take away this discretion — turn “talk to strangers” into a predetermined plan for the number of people you must approach and the specific questions you must ask them — and your brain’s deceptive power in the moment is neutralized. All the reasons you couldn’t or shouldn’t do the thing you were planning to do shrivel away, leaving behind only the bare bones of the thing that is holding you back — the fear.For this reason, I spent months before traveling to New York wrapping structure around the trip. I mapped out all the flea markets in the city and the dates I would visit them. I created detailed plans for the exercises I had to do each day, including scripts of what I had to say and spreadsheets to record what happened. The idea was to leave no space for discretion when doing the scary thing, so that when I was in the moment, it was just me and the fear.In addition to the conversations I had prepared, I started each day of the bootcamp with an extra exercise I’d read about from fear-facing expert Tim Ferriss. Every morning, I’d enter my local coffee shop, and after ordering my drink, I’d force myself to lie down on the floor in the middle of the store. For 20 seconds, with no explanation or advance warning, I’d lie there — eyes open, silently counting to 20 — as the rest of the café looked on in confusion. Then I would get up, pick up my coffee, and go about my day.It was an extremely weird thing to do, and each time I considered it, my social defense system would go into overdrive, firing every reason it was impossible or unreasonable or unsafe. Feeling the alarm bells go off, putting them aside, and doing the exercise anyway was a great way to start every day of the bootcamp with a small victory of courage over cowardice and set the tone for the rest of the day.Despite the large amount of time and energy I was investing into the trip, I told no one about it. My friends, family, and co-workers knew I was taking an unusually long holiday in New York, but that was it. I did this to avoid chickening out: Research shows that telling others about something difficult you want to do triggers many of the same emotional sensations as actually doing the thing. These sensations can then erode your motivation to actually achieve your goal — because by telling people, you’ve already obtained the identity you were striving for. To mitigate this risk, I kept the whole thing a secret until I returned.During the bootcamp I often felt anxious or uncomfortable, but I never felt unsafe. Part of this came from a set of ground rules I followed — avoiding doing the exercises at night, for example — but another part came from something I got for free: the fact that I am a white man. My privilege afforded me the ability to deliberately place myself in situations that could have turned confrontational without fear of repercussion or physical violence. While the intention of this essay isn’t a commentary on race — anyone can have difficulty with uncomfortable conversations — it is important to acknowledge that were I not a white man, the world may have reacted differently to these behaviors. Sadly, the reality today is that it is not always safe for everyone to embark on a journey like mine.I completed the bootcamp this past October. The trip was extremely impactful, mostly in ways I didn’t expect. Here’s what happened:The bootcamp lived up to its name — it was grueling. I woke up every morning dreading the day ahead, cringing at the list of uncomfortable conversations I’d have to have. I spent large chunks of time sitting in flea markets or on park benches with my head in my hands, working up the courage to initiate a conversation that my internal social compass told me was an extremely bad idea. The experience felt a bit like binge-watching Curb Your Enthusiasm, but instead of Larry David saying painfully awkward things to strangers, it was me.In fact, the most surprising part of the experience was how violently my body and brain would revolt when I pushed myself to act like Larry. When I would offer an unfair price to a flea market vendor or ask a line of polite people to cut to the front of the queue, the shock to my system was intense. I felt a wallop to my nervous system as intense as physical pain, and after the experience was over, I felt as drained as though I had just gone for a hard run. After each exercise, I needed nearly 40 minutes to regain the energy to get back in the ring for the next one. And the pain I felt when acting like a jerk didn’t decline much, even after repeating the exercises over and over again for a week.This is probably a good thing. The things I was doing were explicit violations of the social contract: making unfair bargains, asking for things I didn’t deserve, or generally acting unpredictably with others. These are things that I could force myself to do as one-off experiments but are not behaviors I ever want to get used to doing. It was fascinating — and frankly, reassuring — to experience that I probably never could get used to doing them, even if I wanted to; the electric collar of our human instincts is just too strong to overcome.While I never acclimatized to acting like a jerk, the exercises did translate to a meaningful boost to the skill I set out to improve — my ability to have uncomfortable conversations. Since returning to Toronto, I’ve found myself significantly more capable navigating conversations that I previously would have fumbled. In the months since I’ve returned, I’ve provided tough, constructive feedback to direct reports without stumbling through my words. I’ve advocated for controversial strategic decisions to strong-willed colleagues and prevailed. And I’ve approached countless strangers — some for practice, some for important questions or introductions. The results have been overwhelmingly positive. My ability to influence has increased, and my personal and professional relationships have improved. AQ really is a superpower.I think the boost to my AQ has come from three key changes that occurred over the course of the bootcamp. The first is a heightened awareness of how my brain and body react when I engage in a socially uncomfortable interaction. By repeatedly triggering my own anxiety, I’ve learned to recognize the physical and mental sensations that reliably come along with it: the heat and tension in my chest and temples, the images of the expected rejection that play on my mental movie screen, and the emotional pang urging me to avoid, agree, or do whatever is necessary to restore harmony between myself and the person I’m engaging with.Previously, these sensations would occur beneath the blanket of my subconscious, triggering an automatic flight response without any opportunity for my rational brain to intervene. Now, I can usually catch these sensations as they occur, providing me with a precious few seconds to consult my rational brain before my animal instincts react. This brief window is just enough time to ask myself whether my reaction is justified and, if not, to regain control of the machine — to reset my eye contact, organize my thoughts, and effectively deliver the message I was intending. This improved awareness is probably the biggest driver of my AQ gains thus far.This new awareness is complemented by the second change: a more realistic expectation of how people will react when I engage with them. Historically, hanging on a bulletin board in the deep recesses of my subconscious was a memo that read: PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO BE AGREED WITH AND LEFT ALONE. But my experience in New York proved that wasn’t true.Most strangers politely engaged with even my weirdest requests: The man in the coffee shop agreed to let me try a sip of his drink (I declined), the tourist in the park kindly engaged in my investigation of how we might know each other (we didn’t — he was from Australia), and not a single person in the Starbucks line rejected my request to jump ahead. Of course, the responses of cautious strangers are not perfect predictors of how people will respond in real-life interactions, but the upshot still matters: My projections for how people will react to being approached or challenged are often much worse than the reactions actually are. Now when I ask my rational brain whether the thing I’m about to say will upset the person, I’m much more likely to get the answer right.Finally, surviving the bootcamp has resulted in a newfound confidence to initiate uncomfortable conversations in the first place. My experiments at the extreme end of the AQ spectrum have increased my social risk tolerance, making normal, run-of-the-mill awkwardness seem almost blasé. Once you’ve asked a line of impatient New Yorkers to get your coffee before theirs, summoning the courage to provide respectful feedback to a co-worker feels a bit like a layup. The old adage about your comfort zone is true: The further you stretch outside of it, the more it stretches to meet you there.Shortly after returning from New York, I was called into a meeting at work to discuss an urgent issue about a project I was responsible for. The organizer of the meeting — a peer in another department who was known to have a short fuse — was concerned about the issue and demanded that one of my teams drop everything to fix it. When I surfaced my concerns with this plan — the team had already committed to another deadline — he lost his cool, exploding into bluster and dismissing my concerns in irritated exasperation. The room tensed up, and everybody looked to me for how I would react.This was the moment I had been training for — head-to-head conflict with an aggressive opponent — and the perfect opportunity to flex my new AQ muscles. But I was shaken by being yelled at, hurt by his condescending tone, and in the moment, I stumbled. Instead of observing my own discomfort, consulting my rational brain, and then calmly and respectfully voicing my disagreement like I had practiced, I reacted too quickly, responded too agreeably, and ultimately downplayed my concerns. After the meeting was over and my head was clear, I realized this was a mistake and had to schedule a time-consuming follow-up meeting to relitigate the whole issue. I had failed.I wrestled with early failures like this one a lot in the first few weeks after the trip. I had put everything I had into improving my assertiveness. I flew to New York City. I had a lifetime of painful conversations. I spent every morning on the floor of a hip East Harlem coffee shop, publicly humiliating myself. And still, I wasn’t as assertive as I wanted to be. What did this say about the impact of the trip — was all of that discomfort for naught? Or more precisely, was the optimistic philosophy underpinning the entire exercise — that deep-seated aspects of our character are as pliable as a tennis swing — naive? Was I stuck the way I was?I eventually found the answer hiding in the words of my own question. If I, a novice tennis player, signed up for a weeklong bootcamp to improve my backhand, I wouldn’t expect to return home ready to dominate at Wimbledon. That would be ludicrous; everyone knows that mastering a skill takes years, even with intensive practice. So if I was modeling my assertiveness training on traditional athletic improvement, why was I expecting the results to be any different?Put more scientifically, in constructing my bootcamp, I had recruited the first half of Ericsson’s research on expertise — that with the proper application of deliberate practice, humans can get good at anything. But when extending that theory from acquiring a technical skill like a tennis swing to a social skill like assertiveness, I forgot to include the second half of Ericsson’s findings: that mastery takes a tremendous amount of time.“Expert performers,” writes Ericsson in Peak, his 2016 opus on how great people become great, “develop their extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step by step in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts.”In other words, far from invalidating my philosophy, the bootcamp — and my experience in the weeks and months that followed — have cemented it, albeit with a sobering dose of reality. Our abilities, be they motor skills like a tennis swing or social skills like assertiveness, are profoundly malleable, with enormous upward potential and a ceiling we don’t know and can’t predict. But skills are skills, and there is no weeklong exercise or secret hack to short circuit the path to mastery. There’s only one way to get there — and that’s to keep setting up the ball machine.Special thanks to Rachel Kattapuram, Jamie McDonald, Jamie Shulman, Zack Belzberg, Eli and Alex Gladstone, Noam and Yael Pratzer, Talia Schlanger, Geoff Gualano, Liam Kearney, Vanessa Chung, Mark Shiner, Laura Shiner, and Micah Vernon for reading early drafts of this essay.[1] I got many of the ideas for the unusual conversations from Jason Comely’s Rejection Therapy game, designed to help players get more comfortable with rejection by asking strangers to do things they will almost certainly decline.[2] Because of logistical challenges, I only ended up having time for 21 uncomfortable negotiations. I made up for it by having four extra conversations with strangers to ensure I hit my total of 50 conversations. These extra conversations included several normal conversations, such as asking people where they suggested I visit in the city or where they purchased their laptop case. I realized that by having exclusively weird conversations with strangers, I was at risk of conditioning myself to expect others to respond negatively to my advances. Balancing out my unusual conversations with a handful of normal conversations felt like a healthy way to ensure I didn’t finish the bootcamp more uncomfortable than I started."

What if failure is the plan?,danah boyd,Dec 5,https://zephoria.medium.com/what-if-failure-is-the-plan-2f219ea1cd62?source=home---------6------------------0----------,"I’ve been thinking a lot about failure lately. Failure comes in many forms, but I’m especially interested in situations in which people *perceive* something as failing (or about to fail) and the contestations over failure that often arise in such situations. Given this, it’s hard not to be fascinated by all that’s unfolding around Twitter. At this point in the story of Musk’s takeover, there’s a spectrum of perspectives about Twitter’s pending doom (or lack thereof). But there’s more to failure than the binary question of “will Twitter fail or won’t it?” Here’s some thoughts on how I’m thinking about the failure question…I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the aughts trying to understand the rise and fall of social network sites like Friendster and MySpace. I noticed something fascinating. If a central node in a network disappeared and went somewhere else (like from MySpace to Facebook), that person could pull some portion of their connections with them to a new site. However, if the accounts on the site that drew emotional intensity stopped doing so, people stopped engaging as much. Watching Friendster come undone, I started to think that the fading of emotionally sticky nodes was even more problematic than the disappearance of segments of the graph.With MySpace, I was trying to identify the point where I thought the site was going to unravel. When I started seeing the disappearance of emotionally sticky nodes, I reached out to members of the MySpace team to share my concerns and they told me that their numbers looked fine. Active uniques were high, the amount of time people spent on the site was continuing to grow, and new accounts were being created at a rate faster than accounts were being closed. I shook my head; I didn’t think that was enough. A few months later, the site started to unravel.On a different project, I was talking with a cis/hetero dating site that was struggling with fraud. Many of its “fake” accounts were purportedly “women” but they were really a scam to entice people into paying for a porn site. But when the site started removing these profiles, they found that the site as a whole was unraveling. Men didn’t like these fake women, but their profiles enticed them to return. Moreover, attractive women saw these profiles and felt like it was a site full of people more attractive than them so they came. When the fake women disappeared, the real women disappeared. And so did the men.Network effects intersect with perception to drive a sense of a site’s social relevance and interpersonal significance.I don’t have access to the Twitter social graph these days, but I’d bet my bottom dollar that it would indicate whether or not the site was on a trajectory towards collapse. We are certainly seeing entire sub-networks flock to Mastodon, but that’s not as meaningful as people might think because of the scale and complexity of the network graph. You can lose whole segments and not lose a site. However, if those departing are creating Swiss cheese into the network graph, then I would worry.The bigger question concerns those emotionally sticky nodes. What constitutes a “can’t be missed” account or post varies. What draws someone to a service like Twitter varies. For some, it is the libidinal joy of seeing friends and community, the posts that provide light touch pleasure and joy. For others, it’s a masochistic desire for seeing content that raises one’s blood pressure. Still others can’t resist the drama of a train wreck.The funny thing about Twitter’s feed algorithms is that they were designed to amplify the content that triggered the most reaction, those emotionally sticky posts. This is why boring but informative content never has a chance against that which prompts fury. But it also means that we’re all watching how our little universe of content is changing (or not). Are you still seeing the things that give you pleasure? Or just the stuff that makes you angry? Why can’t you resist looking away from the things that give you pain? (That question isn’t a new one… it’s the question that underlies our toxic social media ecology more generally.)I have to give Musk and gang some credit for knowing that drama brings traffic. The drama that unfolds in the World Cup is wholesome compared to the drama of watching public acts of humiliation, cruelty, and hate. We’re in a modern day Coliseum watching a theater of suffering performed for the king under the rubric of “justice.” And just like the ancient Romans, we can’t look away.But how long can the spectacle last? Even the Roman Empire eventually collapsed, but perhaps the theater of the absurd can persist for a while. Still, there are other factors to consider.Nearly everyone I talk with is surprised that the actual service of Twitter is mostly still working. What that says to me is that the engineering team was far more solid than I appreciated. Any engineering team worth its salt is going to build redundancy and resilience into the system. Exceptions that are thrown should be caught and managed. But that doesn’t mean that a system can persist indefinitely without maintenance and repair.Think of it in terms of a house. If you walk away from your home for a while, the pipes will probably keep working fine on their own. Until a big freeze comes. And then, if no one is looking, they’ll burst, flood the house, and trigger failure after failure. The reason for doing maintenance is to minimize the likelihood of this event. And the reason to have contingencies built in is to prevent a problem from rippling across the system.What happens when Twitter’s code needs to be tweaked to manage an iOS upgrade? Or if a library dependency goes poof? What happens when a security vulnerability isn’t patched?One interesting concept in organizational sociology is “normal accidents theory.” Studying Three Mile Island, Charles Perrow created a 2x2 grid before b-schools everywhere made this passé.One axis represented the complexity of interactions in a system; the other axis reflected the “coupling” of a system. A loosely coupled system has little dependencies, but a tightly coupled system has components that are highly dependent on others. Perrow argued that “normal accidents” were nearly inevitable in a complex, tightly coupled system. To resist such an outcome, systems designers needed to have backups and redundancy, safety checks and maintenance. In the language of computers, resilience requires having available “buffer” to manage any overflow.Having dozens of engineers working around the clock to respond to crises can temporarily prevent failure. But those engineers will get tired, mistakes will happen, and maintenance will get kicked down the road. Teams need buffer as much as systems do.I’m concerned about the state of the team at Twitter, not just because so many people were laid off. If my hunch is right, many of the engineers who are keeping Twitter going fall into four groups. There are immigrants on H1Bs who are effectively indentured servants, many of whom would leave if they could, but the industry is falling apart which makes departures unlikely. There are also apolitical engineers who need a job and there are few jobs to be found in the industry right now. Neither of these groups will want to drive themselves to the bone in the long term. Then there are Musk fanboys who want to ride this rollercoaster for whatever personal motivation. And there are goons on loan from other public companies that Musk owns. (Side note: how how how is it legal for Musk to use employees from public companies for his private project!?!? Is this something that the Delaware courts are going to influence?)In the early days of Twitter, moments of failure were celebrated with a Fail Whale, the iconic image that Twitter posted when something went terribly awry in the system, requiring it to be shut down and, effectively, rebooted. It’s been a long time since we saw the Fail Whale because there was a strong infrastructure team who worked to bake resilience into the system. In other words, Twitter grew up.How long can the resilience of the system allow it to keep functioning? It could be quite a while. But I also can’t help but think of a video I saw years ago about what would happen to New York City if the humans suddenly disappeared overnight. First the pipes burst and the rats invaded. But without humans leaving behind trash, the rats eventually died. The critters that remained? The cockroaches of course.If you searched for “miserable failure” (or even just “failure”) on September 29, 2006, the first result was the official George W. Bush biography. This act of “Google bombing” made the internet lol. But it also hinted at a broader dynamic related to failure. There are failures that everyone can agree are failures (e.g. the explosion of the Challenger), but most failures are a matter of perception.Politicians, policies, companies, and products are often deemed a “failure” rhetorically by those who oppose them, regardless of any empirical measure one might use. George W. Bush was deemed a failure by those who were opposed to his “War on Terrorism.” Declaring something a failure is a way to delegitimize it. And when something is delegitimized, it can become a failure.I often think back to MySpace’s downfall. In 2007, I penned a controversial blog post noting a division that was forming as teenagers self-segregated based on race and class in the US, splitting themselves between Facebook and MySpace. A few years later, I noted the role of the news media in this division, highlighting how media coverage about MySpace as scary, dangerous, and full of pedophiles (regardless of empirical evidence) helped make this division possible. The news media played a role in delegitimizing MySpace (aided and abetted by a team at Facebook, which was directly benefiting from this delegitimization work).Perception (including racism and classism) have shaped the social media landscape since the beginning.A lot has changed about our news media ecosystem since 2007. In the United States, it’s hard to overstate how the media is entangled with contemporary partisan politics and ideology. This means that information tends not to flow across partisan divides in coherent ways that enable debate. In general, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the left declare conservative politicians/policies to be failures, this has little impact on the right because it is actively ignored by the media outlets consumed by those on the right. But interestingly, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the right declare progressive politicians/policies to be failures, both mainstream media and the left obsessively amplify falsehoods and offensive content in an attempt to critique and counteract them. (Has anyone on the left managed to avoid hearing about the latest round of celebrity anti-Semitism?)I’m especially fascinated by how the things that are widely deemed failures are deemed failures for different reasons across the political spectrum. Consider the withdrawal in Afghanistan. The right did a fantastic job of rhetorically spinning this as a Biden failure, while the left criticized aspects of the mission. This shared perception of failure landed in the collective public consciousness; there was no need to debate why individual groups saw it as failure. Of course, this also meant that there was no shared understanding of what led to that point, no discussion of what should’ve been done other than it should’ve been done better. Perceptions of failure don’t always lead to shared ideas of how to learn from these lessons.The partisan and geopolitical dimensions of perception related to Twitter are gobsmacking. Twitter has long struggled to curb hate, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, and harassment. For a long time, those on the right have labeled these efforts censorship. Under the false flag of freedom of speech, the new Twitter has eradicated most safeguards, welcoming in a new era of amplified horrors, with the news media happily covering this spectacle. (This is what led Joan Donovan and I to talk about the importance of strategic silence.)Musk appears to be betting that the spectacle is worth it. He’s probably correct in thinking that large swaths of the world will not deem his leadership a failure either because they are ideologically aligned with him or they simply don’t care and aren’t seeing any changes to their corner of the Twitterverse.He also appears to believe that the advertising community will eventually relent because they always seem to do so when an audience is lingering around. And with a self-fashioned Gladiator torturing his enemies for sport in front of a live audience, there are lots of dollars on the table. Musk appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out.So the big question in my mind is: how effective will the perception that Twitter is failing be in the long run, given how it is not jumping across existing ideological divisions? Perception of failure can bring about failure, but it doesn’t always. That’s the story of many brands who resist public attacks. Perception of failure can also just fade into the background, reifying existing divisions.Of course, a company needs money and the only revenue stream Twitter has stems from advertising. This is one of the reasons that activism around the advertisers matters. If advocates can convince advertisers to hold out, that will starve a precarious system. That is a tangible way to leverage perception of failure. Same can be said if advocates manage to convince Apple or Google to de-list. Or if perception can be leveraged into court fights, Congressional battles, or broader policy sanctions. But right now, it seems as though perception has gotten caught in the left/right cultural war that is unfolding in the United States.There are many ways in which the Twitter story could end, but it’s important to remember that most companies do eventually end (or become unrecognizable after 100+ years). The internet is littered with failed companies. And even though companies like Yahoo! still have a website, they are in a “permanently failing” status. Most companies fail when they run out of money. And the financials around Twitter are absurd. As a company, it has persisted almost entirely on a single profit stream: advertising. That business strategy requires eyeballs. As we’ve already witnessed, a subscription plan for salvation is a joke.The debt financing around Twitter is gob-smacking. I cannot for the life of me understand what the creditors were thinking, but the game of finance is a next level sport where destroying people, companies, and products to achieve victory is widely tolerated. Historical trends suggest that the losers in this chaos will not be Musk or the banks, but the public.For an anchor point, consider the collapse of local news journalism. The myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn’t give a shit about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of town. So financiers squeezed the news orgs until there was no money to be squeezed and then they hung them out to dry. There was no configuration in which local news was going to survive, no magical upwards trajectory of revenue based on advertising alone. If it weren’t for craigslist and Google, the financiers would’ve squeezed these enterprises for a few more years, but the end state was always failure. Failure was the profit strategy for the financiers. (It still boggles my mind how many people believe that the loss of news journalism is because of internet advertising. I have to give financiers credit for their tremendous skill at shifting the blame.)I highly doubt that Twitter is going to be a 100-year company. For better or worse, I think failure is the end state for Twitter. The question is not if but when, how, and who will be hurt in the process?Right now, what worries me are the people getting hurt. I’m sickened to watch “journalists” aid and abet efforts to publicly shame former workers (especially junior employees) in a sadistic game of “accountability” that truly perverts the concept. I’m terrified for the activists and vulnerable people around the world whose content exists in Twitter’s databases, whose private tweets and DMs can be used against them if they land in the wrong hands (either by direct action or hacked activity). I’m disgusted to think that this data will almost certainly be auctioned off.Frankly, there’s a part of me that keeps wondering if there’s a way to end this circus faster to prevent even greater harms. (Dear Delaware courts, any advice?)No one who creates a product wants to envision failure as an inevitable end state. Then again, humans aren’t so good at remembering that death is an inevitable end state either. But when someone doesn’t estate plan, their dependents are left with a mess. Too many of us have watched the devastating effects of dementia and, still, few of us plan for all that can go wrong when our minds fall apart and we lash out at the ones we love. Few companies die a graceful death either. And sadly, that’s what I expect we’re about to see. A manic, demented creature hurting everyone who loved it on its way out the door.I’m not omniscient. I don’t know where this story ends. But after spending the last few years obsessing over what constitutes failure, I can’t help but watch this situation with a rock in my stomach.Failure isn’t a state, but a process. It can be a generative process. After all, some plants only grow after a forest fire. (And yes, yes, tech is currently obsessed with “fail fast.” But frankly, that’s more about a status game than actually learning.)Failure should not always be the end goal. There’s much to be said about the journey, about living a worthy life, about growing and learning and being whole. Yet, what keeps institutions, systems, companies, and products whole stems from how they are configured within a network of people, practices, and perception. Radical shifts in norms, values, and commitments can rearrange how these networks are configured. This is why transitions are hard and require a well-thought through strategy to prevent failure, especially if the goal is to be whole ethically.Watching this situation unfold, a little voice keeps nagging in my head. How should our interpretation of this situation shift if we come to believe that failure is the desired end goal? There’s a big difference between a natural forest fire and one that stems from the toxic mixture of arson and climate change."

What Marriage Means to Me,Chasten Buttigieg,Nov 29,https://chasten.medium.com/what-marriage-means-to-me-a6bdd72cffe1?source=home---------8------------------0----------,"After dropping the kids off, I came home and stopped in the kitchen to take in the aftermath of our chaotic morning together. And it got me thinking.There were the bibs I should have tossed in the sink that were leaking milk onto the counter. Their little toothbrushes they used to scrub the teeth that have been keeping them up at night. Tiny hairbands from Penelope’s quick updo in which she kept repeating the word “bosh” while I brushed her hair as she wiggled her head out of my grasp with each stroke. The stacked plates, empty and crusty after a hurried but hilarious breakfast full of giggles ad music. The twins and I bounced along to the Christmas music as they ate their bananas and eggs while I prayed for the coffee maker to go faster. Pete used to protest Christmas music in the morning, now he encourages it. Parenting changes us, doesn’t it?He danced around me and fed the dogs while singing along, getting the kids to smile and giggle with his silly faces and voices — while doing his best not to get anything on his suit pants before rushing out the door and off to the to the airport. I didn’t remember where he was headed, but I knew it was important.This is what marriage is to me.Mornings spent negotiating the daily schedule while stuffing diaper bags. It’s the sweat-inducing challenge of getting a sweater on a wiggling toddler and the smile that comes from how cute they are once you succeed. It’s scattered building blocks on the floor and scrambled eggs on the wall. It’s goodbye kisses at the door and thermoses of coffee in the minivan. It’s having the right to juggle it all with the person who makes you feel loved and supported amidst the chaos.It’s the right to have a shoulder to lean on at end of the day in the first place.It’s the promise of hard work for your partner, your kids, and for us, our country.My marriage has filled this house with so much love it makes me want to be a better husband, father, and citizen every day. It’s called me to something bigger than myself while recognizing that my kids are now the most important thing in life, and I’d do anything to protect them. Our family and our union push me to make sure we leave our kids a country and a world they can thrive in so that they, too, can enjoy all of the love and light and happiness that Pete and I have known simply by falling in love with one another.I know how precious this union is and how sacred and fragile our unions can be in the eyes of our ever-changing democracy. We are not yet afforded the pleasure of letting our shoulders down, of taking a breath. We are fully aware that some desperately want to take this away. I hope that we can move on from these votes, these arguments, and these debates soon.The Senate is poised to vote on the #RespectForMarriageAct today. I hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle will listen to over 70% of Americans and vote to protect families like mine and the unions that make us all better Americans.And if a member of congress is confused, or has questions and wants to turn down the noise from the online rhetoric — our playroom is always open, should you want to meet a family who is just trying their best to make their kids happy and their country better, just like you."
6 Steps for Setting Measurable Goals to Avoid “Productivity Paranoia”,Kim Scott,Oct 26,https://kimmalonescott.medium.com/6-steps-for-setting-measurable-goals-to-avoid-productivity-paranoia-e1e16da00546?source=home---------93------------------0----------,"With more people working in remote and hybrid environments than ever before, company, team and individual goals must be explicit and measurable. Setting goals is an ideal way to stave off what Microsoft calls “productivity paranoia.”According to new research from Microsoft WorkLab, this is defined as: “A fear among leaders that remote and hybrid employees are being less productive than they would be in an office full-time, even though people are working more than ever.”Colette Stallbaumer, the general manager for Microsoft 365 and “future of work,” tells CNBC that leaders need to shift their focus from activity to impact.“The most important question they should be asking themselves is: ‘How can I create clarity and help people understand what to prioritize so we’re rewarding employees’ impact, not just their activity?’”The best way to do this is to set clear, measurable goals, so folks aren’t spinning their wheels 24/7 trying to figure out what they need to get done.For setting goals, Google used a system called Objectives and Key Results (“OKRs”), an approach to goal-setting borrowed from Intel. This is certainly not the only approach, and it’s not perfect, but of all the systems I’ve experienced, this one works best.Volumes have been written about this system, and there’s a great video that Google Ventures produced explaining the whole system (which you can watch below), so I will try to describe it as briefly as possible.The hardest part of this system for me was understanding that the OKRs shouldn’t be top-down. If I wanted goals to be achieved, I couldn’t just set them.Instead, I had to listen broadly to what people hoped to achieve, push them to clarify their ideas, encourage debate about competing ideas, let everyone know how they are going to participate in deciding what to do and make sure that the resulting decision persuades everyone.Once I’d seen the results, I had to learn from what happened so that the team and I could adjust.I have to do all this extremely efficiently, or else we’d spend all our time setting goals and none of our time achieving them.I did not do nearly as good a job coming up with annual and quarterly OKRs for my teams at Google. First, I tried just setting them. They were often irrelevant and always ignored. Then I would write a “draft” and ask the team to edit it.We limped along for a couple of years, all of us dreading the long, tedious, too-big meetings we had discussing the goals I’d proposed. Finally, Scott Sheffer, a manager on my team, came up with a much better process.He came into my office one day and relieved me of my responsibility for coming up with the first draft of our “objective and key results.”“You get to edit the plan; you do not get to write it,” he said to me.“But it will not be coherent!” I protested. “All the different teams will want to do different things, and the different regions will put yet another spin on things. It will be chaos.”“Give them a chance.”I did, and sure enough, they came up with a far better first draft than I could ever have done. Was it perfectly efficient? No! They had to start a few weeks earlier than I would have because they had to have a bunch of debates.But, as a result of those debates, they came up with a plan that they could actually commit to. As a result, we accomplished a lot more that quarter than we ever had before.Here’s the process Scott came up with.Share the context: Scott made sure to share the context with the team. This spared him from listening to irrelevant ideas. Scott didn’t have the depth of knowledge that the people reporting to him had over their respective areas.But he did know a lot more than they did about how what the AdSense team was doing fit into broader goals at Google and other teams’ work. By sharing this context, he prevented (most of the time) teams from pursuing ideas that just weren’t that important.Break down the categories and identify people who are in charge of each: Like Eric identified the 12 “strategy” questions, Scott broke down the problem of quarterly and annual goal-setting into several discrete categories and assigned teams to each.This helped the team avoid the “blank sheet of paper” syndrome and get going quickly. We might never have come away with goals if Scott had asked a team of 100 people to define the categories and then organize teams to approach each one.Scott made himself available along the way. Like Eric, Scott met with each team twice to help them if they were stuck and give them course corrections if necessary.Require owners and metrics for each goal: When writing a goal collectively, it was easy for teams to get sloppy in their thinking. When each goal could be measured, and somebody was on the hook for achieving that number, much crisper goals came out of the process.Team goals had to have a person who was ultimately accountable. Each individual on the team had to have goals that contributed to the broader team goal and understand what their contribution was expected to be.Set the constraints: Scott also limited the number of goals each team could set for itself. This constraint forced teams to be clear about what they were really going to do each quarter, instead of putting together a laundry list of things they hoped to do but probably wouldn’t get to.Schedule presentations: In addition to helping along the way, Scott had each team present ideas to each other. These presentations were extremely short — the goal was to be able to explain a quarter’s work in 15 minutes or less.These presentations aimed to ensure that ideas were easy to understand, not persuade others that these were the right OKRs.Require debate but limit duration and frequency: Scott carefully managed how long and how often each team could meet to debate ideas, and once they’d finalized their idea, he had them present and debate with other teams.Be clear about how the final strategy will be decided: Scott set up a series of meetings with “final deciders” two weeks before the end of the quarter to review proposed goals.I was one of the final deciders, and I suppose I could have vetoed decisions I didn’t like, but I never came close to doing that.During the last week of the quarter, Scott asked each team to present the goals at an all-hands meeting. The team coming up with the goal generally presented the logic, since they had the most credibility. It often fell to Scott, though, to address the emotions in the room.Require goals to be transparent and measurable: The numbers generally made the logic of a goal clear and tended to be extremely persuasive. Everyone on Scott’s team could see everyone else’s goals, and also whether or not they were hitting them.This increased the accountability that people felt for hitting their goals, and also encouraged people to aim for impressive results. It also tended to decrease the tendency for one team to assume another team is “doing nothing.”Show a connection between the team and company goals: The key thing here was not to be too literal. One of the tricky things about goal-setting at a company as big as Google was reconciling a small team’s goals with company-wide goals.For example, Scott worked on the AdSense team. In some quarters there would be a company-wide AdSense goal; in other quarters there wouldn’t be.And when there was a company-wide AdSense goal, the owner was never anyone from sales, but always somebody from the product or engineering teams. The key was to make sure the team understood how their efforts and successes were contributing to Google’s broader efforts and successes.Grade goals regularly, continually if possible: The team who set the goals was responsible for grading them — my team and I sometimes had a review to make sure the grading was reasonable. Whenever possible, goals were continually and automatically graded.For example, a customer satisfaction goal could be calculated daily and even hourly. However, other goals had to get graded manually.All goals would be graded mid-quarter. This was important for two reasons.One, it gave the teams a chance to learn whether or not they had set the right goals and whether they were on the right track while there was still time to adjust.Two, since we had to set the next quarter’s goals before the final grades were in on the current quarter, it was important to have a sense of how things were going.We reviewed the mid-point grades at my staff meeting and then presented them at our team’s all-hands meeting on the sixth week of the quarter; we did the same for final grades on the first week of the next quarter.If the listen-clarify-debate-decide-persuade-learn wheel at Google was spinning pretty slowly for mission and culture, which were set but still moving forward when I got there, it moved a little faster for strategy.For OKRs, the wheel was always spinning pretty fast. It wasn’t always perfectly clear how the OKRs of teams, even teams working on the same product, meshed. For a while, we tried setting joint OKRs between the different teams working on AdSense: product, engineering, marketing, direct sales, and online sales.In the end, we found it wasn’t worth the coordination effort. It was better for each team to set their own goals separately, and share them as soon as they were ready. If there were a major disconnect, we’d reconcile, but generally, this worked out.The process for coming up with the top-level company OKRs was pretty clear. Not everyone got included, but it was OK because everything was transparent.Once everyone knows and understands their goals they can spend time working toward them and making an impact versus developing productivity paranoia because they have no clue how they should prioritize their work.Get more insights from Kim Scott on her Just Work blog >>Sign up for our Radical Candor email newsletter >>Shop the Radial Candor store >>Need help practicing Radical Candor?

How to overcome common objections to bike lanes,Michael Schneider,Oct 29,https://michaelschneider.medium.com/how-to-overcome-common-objections-to-bike-lanes-9d6edc5a8a0c?source=home---------65------------------0----------,"In my 3+ years of local advocacy I’ve heard every objection under the sun to putting in safe bike infrastructure. It seems that no one objects to bike lanes themselves, but they object to the reallocation of space that make safe bike lanes possible. Drivers seem to view roads as exclusively for them, and that any other proposed use is blasphemy. Note that most of this is specific to LA, but the objections (and retorts) are usually the same everywhere. Also, while I focused on bike lanes below, many of these same arguments can be made for bus lanes or neighborhood traffic calming. Here are some objections I’ve heard and how to overcome them:1. “You’re putting in bike lanes that no one uses anyway.” This is probably the most common thing I hear — that no one bikes in LA, so why bother putting in bike lanes. First, it’s not true that no one bikes, but it is true that most people don’t. The reason for this is that we have had a scattershot approach to adding bike lanes, and they don’t connect to each other, and are usually in the door zone. Therefore, they don’t form a safe network and don’t take people to where they need to go most of the time.THE RETORT: It’s likely not true that “no one” uses the bike lanes — but bikes are much quieter than cars and take up less space, so it’s easier to miss them go by. Also, since the city doesn’t have a network of bike lanes that actually make people feel safe (protected bike lanes), most people aren’t willing to risk riding their bike only for the lane to magically disappear, forcing them to share the road with speeding cars. By supporting more bike lanes, we can create a network of protected bike lanes, which once created, will be used by many more people that would otherwise likely be in a car.2. “LA is too spread out, it won’t work here. This isn’t Amsterdam.” This one is easy to talk to, as the statement assumes that every trip must start on one side of Los Angeles and end on the opposite side (and yes, that is likely too far to bike for most). But the vast majority of trips are possible.THE RETORT: While it’s true that not every trip in LA could be done by bike, 50% of car trips every day are going 3 miles or less (less than a 15 minute bike ride), 66% of car trips every day are going 5 miles or less (less than a 30 minute bike ride). People don’t need a to drive a mile to the grocery store, or two miles to run an errand — they do it because they feel like they have no safe alternative. Most people don’t like traffic or having to look for a parking space, and a bike solves both. But people are only going to use bikes if they feel like they’re not going to die in the street with poor infrastructure.3. “No one is going to ride to work, they don’t want to show up sweaty” or “no one is going to ride up a big hill,” or “no one is going to ride to carry heavy groceries home.”THE RETORT: E-bikes. E-bikes are the solution for those that live up a hill, or have a hilly commute, or need to carry something heavy. And with major e-bike manufacturers now offering e-bikes under $1,000, they can be true car replacements in hilly or heavy cargo situations.4. “You’re going to make pollution and traffic worse with idling cars stuck in gridlock if you take away a traffic lane.” This is a very common one, the myth that by giving people infrastructure for alternatives to the car, you’re just making pollution worse.THE RETORT: It’s true that if we put in non-car infrastructure and no one uses it, then traffic may get worse. However, case studies from around the world have shown the opposite. When cities make cycling safer and more attractive, a subset of the population decide to use the infrastructure, replacing a car trip. Over time, traffic actually gets better than before the change, with people doing a mode shift to a something that causes no pollution, is healthier, doesn’t wear down the road, and is much safer for those around them in the event of a crash.5. “There’s been no outreach on this project.” I think I’ve heard this line every single time I’ve been involved in a project that is even a little controversial. Here’s the hard truth: there will NEVER be enough outreach for people opposed to change. Usually, “outreach” is code for “I don’t like the project and want to use process to kill it.THE RETORT: In Los Angeles, thanks to NIMBY lawsuits against the City’s Mobility Plan 2035, the city is actually required to do a ton of outreach when considering a road reconfiguration on a major corridor. This usually results in multiple community meetings (both online and offline), tabling farmers markets, and sending mailers to homes near the street in question.6. “Bike lanes will mean emergency services can’t get through.” When the outreach excuse doesn’t work, some go to this one. It’s also completely false.THE RETORT: In cities with huge bike networks — many of which are in Northern Europe — you don’t hear of buildings burning down because the fire truck can’t get there fast enough, or of people having heart attacks and the ambulance not being able to get through. And these cities often have narrower streets than we do. In an emergency, it’s possible bike infrastructure could be used by an ambulance or fire engine — and in some parts of the world, there are bike paramedics that can arrive faster than their vehicular counterparts. In fact, LAFD even has a bike medics program. Bike lanes don’t stop emergency services.7. “You’re going to kill local businesses if you take away car space/parking.” People often protect parking spaces as if it’s their god given right to have free parking exactly in front of where they need to go at any time of day. But it’s not.THE RETORT: Study after study has shown the opposite — that when you calm traffic down, widen a sidewalk, add a bike lane, add trees, and make a street feel more like a Main St and less like a highway, people want to be there more and therefore businesses get more foot traffic. Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica is a great example of this. Here’s another recent study from New York City.8. “No one is going to bike when it rains / when it’s cold / when it’s hot.” LA has some of the most temperate weather in the world, so this is really a dubious excuse. Kids in Finland bike themselves to school on safe infrastructure in the snow! But when people are used to being ensconced in a vehicle, anything other than a controlled 72 degrees with no wind or sun can seem daunting.THE RETORT: The places in the world with the highest percentage of people riding bikes — Denmark, The Netherlands, France, Germany — have some of the worst weather in the word. In the words of one of my European friends, there is no bad weather, just bad dress. One of my favorite things to use in the rain is a Cleverhood — for the ~2 weeks a year it rains in LA. In the sun, I use a hat and sunscreen, and a newly purchased neck/ear protector. It’s all very doable.9. “I have kids, I can’t bike.” A very common one is that taking kids around by bike is impossible.THE RETORT: Electric cargo bikes solve this. Radpower has a large range of cargo bikes that accommodate one or two kids on one bike. Bakfiets — cargo bikes with the cargo in front — are also great. I personally have a Load 75, and it allows me to take my kids around pollution free, traffic free, and stress free. It has seats with seatbelts for 3 kids, a rain/sun shade, suspension, and up to 100 mile range. I also threw in a Bluetooth speaker and a fan into it, so they have “A/C” on hot days and music.10. “Cyclists don’t pay to use the road, I shouldn’t have to subsidize bike lanes.” This is one of my favorites — the idea that, because cyclists don’t, for example, fill up with gas and pay the associated sales taxes, that they don’t pay for their road use.THE RETORT: First, gas taxes alone don’t cover the cost of road maintenance. How is the difference between gas taxes and the true cost of road maintenance bridged? By general taxpayer dollars — through bonds, sales tax measures, property tax measures, and other general fund expenses. In other words, people that’s don’t drive subsidize road maintenance for those that do drive. To put a fine point on it, as cars have gotten heavier (both due to increase in size as well as batteries from electric vehicles), the roads have had to be repaved more often, making that gap even larger. Someone who bikes is actually doing drivers a favor — their tax dollars go towards repairing the road damaged caused by their heavy vehicle, while not contributing themselves to any wear and tear.11. “There’s no space for bike lanes.” This one is interesting, as humans decide how to allocate road space. If you went back 150 years ago, there’d be no such thing as space for cars — it would’ve been a mix of streetcars, horses, pedestrians, and cyclists. If you go back 100 years ago, the majority of space still wasn’t for cars. It was only post World War 2 that cities began to deconstruct their streetcar systems and the federal government began plowing highways through cities — all Destruction For Nada. This question was inspired by Evan Meckelnburg’s tweet about a county traffic engineer explaining why there wasn’t enough space for safe bike facilities on a street.THE RETORT: When someone says “there isn’t enough space” what they really mean is they don’t want to reallocate the existing space to another use. So then the question becomes, what percentage of the street is for cars? If it’s like most streets in most American cities — 100% — then the next question is, is that fair? Why should pedestrians and cyclists be pushed to the margins or be forced to share space with quickly moving 2 ton metal boxes? Why should the bus — which is far more efficient at moving people — be forced into sitting in traffic with private vehicles? Usually by asking these questions — if the person on the receiving end is honest about it — they will reflect and perhaps realize the inequity.12. “By taking away car space, you’re hurting disabled people that don’t have the luxury of biking.” This one has had a resurgence lately, especially with some of LA’s newest bike lanes. I was at an event last week celebrating the new parking protected bike lanes on San Vicente with Mayor Garcetti and two of my kids (on our way to biking to school) when a woman came up to the Mayor and starting telling him how the new bike lanes were a disaster for disabled people. But LADOT designs these facilites with ADA compliance in mind.THE RETORT: Not everyone has to bike or bike for every trip— and that’s ok! If someone is physically disabled so they’re unable to ride a bike, no one expects them to use a bike lane. The engineers that are designing the facility need to make sure they are designing it in a way that is compatible with disabled people’s needs. For example, with a parking protected bike lane, they should make sure any blue painted parking spots have curb ramps across the bike lane, and signage/paint in the bike lane so cyclists know to watch out for people crossing there. The two things aren’t incompatible, the bike facility just needs to be implemented thoughtfully. This question was inspired by Dan Federman’s tweet.The bottom line is that most objections to bike lanes are a result of uneducated opinions. It’s hard for people to imagine a different built environment than they’re used to. As advocates, instead of just yelling back, it behooves us to stay calm and give facts. It won’t win everyone over, but over time it will win the day."

Elephants in the Room,Scott Galloway,Nov 4,https://medium.com/@profgalloway/elephants-in-the-room-31e072ea75ae?source=home---------36------------------0----------,"In 2017 I wrote a book about Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google called The Four. After working my ass off for 25 years, I became an overnight success: speaking gigs, appearances on cable news and talk shows, book and podcast deals. I spent a bunch of time with elected officials, and powerful people wanted to have lunch with me. People were fascinated — shocked, even — by this simple observation: Big Tech is powerful, maybe too powerful.Much of the concern was a function of the ad-driven nature of platforms — algorithms that tapped into good/bad aspects of human nature to addict us. Most people knew how Facebook and Google made money, but not how they actually worked, how the ad revenue was fueled by the collection of data and the harvesting of attention. In fact, the phrase “Big Tech” was barely known back then. (Check the Wikipedia entry for Big Tech and see which NYU professor is credited with defining the category.) I just read the last sentence and realized I still crave other people’s affirmation. #Pathetic.Anyway, things are different today. We know we’re being tracked, and we understand how digital platforms make money. We also know they’re lucrative, as in, among the fastest growing, most profitable businesses in history. Since A Beautiful Mind won Best Picture in 2002, Google has grown its revenue 625-fold. Digital ads transformed the company from a garage project into a multinational corporation, and turned Meta from a college-campus website into the largest media business in the world. If you had to bet everything, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go with whoever controls our attention. Meta or Google? Safe bets. Snap? Riskier, but the moppets love it. It’s fun to flirt with other sectors and firms, but these companies are the smart, safe bets.Until now.This is proving to be a historically bad year for tech. Few saw it coming. If you bought Facebook stock in 2015, you’ve lost money. If you purchased shares of General Motors, IBM, or Chevron, you’ve made more money than Meta shareholders. Seven years of gains, erased in 10 months. Meta’s meltdown is shocking, but not singular. Google is down 40% this year, Amazon 45%, and Snap 80%. These losses are unprecedented in the Big Tech era.As with bankruptcy, the sell-off happened gradually, then suddenly. Last week was a turning point. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Snap all missed big on earnings. The common theme? Ads. Or lack thereof. We knew the Mad Men era had come to an end; we weren’t expecting the end of Ad Men. But let’s be honest, advertising sucks. Cable ads provide a glimpse into what it’s like to have restless leg syndrome, and digital ads, while more relevant, are carbon — the noxious byproduct of converting attention into shareholder value via algorithms that bring out the worst in the species. I’ll say it again, advertising sucks.In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel. Google’s ad revenue grew just 3% this quarter, down from 43% growth a year ago. For the first time, YouTube ad revenue declined. Snap registered its slowest ad revenue growth ever. Meta’s ad sales, which make up more than 98% of the business, were a trainwreck. Meanwhile (and yes, this brings me joy) the company continues to incinerate $2 billion a month feeding Mark’s fever dream that he is a god of new worlds. BTW, it appears people are more likely to worship Tom: Myspace has more traffic than Meta’s Horizon Worlds.What is/are the meteor(s) that have struck the Genghis & Khan of ads? Meta says the problem is “the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape.” Google blames “the challenging macroclimate.” Snap, “macro headwinds.” Macro, as in, rising inflation, interest rates, and supply chain issues all conspiring to depress advertising demand. And it makes sense, because if people stop spending money on stuff, then the businesses that make that stuff have less money to spend on advertising.But here’s where it gets scary for these companies’ shareholders: The “macro” culprit is a ghost, as people haven’t stopped spending. U.S. consumer spending beat expectations in September, rising 0.6% for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is doing, well, fine — U.S. GDP grew 2.6% last quarter. Of course, there’s still a lot of uncertainty. Growth has slowed, and we’re by no means in the clear. But the weakness we’re seeing in the macroeconomy is a drizzle compared to the Category 5 shitstorm we’re seeing in digital advertising.The state of the economy is a distraction here. Something else is killing ads, and tech companies are reluctant to acknowledge it because, unlike the economy, it’s not cyclical but structural.The elephants in the room are Apple and TikTok. Apple is the larger of the two, figuratively and literally. Last week, the Cupertino giant cemented its position as the most enduring tech company in history: Facing the same macro headwinds as Google and Meta, Apple beat earnings expectations on both the top and bottom lines. At $2.4 trillion in market cap, the company is roughly 10 times more valuable than Meta. Three years ago, it was twice as valuable. It’s getting easier to understand why the Zuck wants out of this universe.Apple may be the last thing an ad-driven platform sees before everything goes black. A year ago, Apple’s iOS upgrade forced apps, including Facebook and Instagram, to ask users for permission to track their data. Meta relies on that data to serve personalized ads that garner greater clicks and sales. So if users opt out, the ads become less effective, and Meta, dramatically less valuable.But few predicted the change would hurt Meta this much. Turns out when Apple’s privacy prompt pops up, only 16% of users agree to being tracked. And if data is the new oil, ad platforms are losing 84% of their Brent Crude. Apple has gone Putin on Meta’s Germany by cutting supply — though this decision was positioned more virtuously, in the name of privacy, vs. war.Without data, the digital ad ecosystem doesn’t work. I saw this play out in real time. Here at Prof G Media, we collect data — specifically, whether or not you opened this email. It’s not powerful data, but it’s data. It helps us understand what resonates. However, several months ago our open rate fell off a cliff. Why? Apple’s privacy change: Every iPhone reader started showing up as a no-open. Overnight, our data had become useless.This newsletter isn’t monetized, so the data blackbox isn’t a game changer. But for most online businesses, it’s dire. Small e-commerce companies across the country have seen customer acquisition costs skyrocket … by 10 times. Why? The ads are no longer shown to the right people at the right time. As a result, small businesses have had to shift spend. Since the iOS upgrade, almost half of e-commerce store owners have decreased their Facebook ad spending by 25% or more. This year, the average price of ads on Meta declined 20%. One year ago, before the privacy change, prices had risen 20%. Tim’s revenge turned Meta, overnight, from a spry, twentysomething growth stock into a Golden Girl, mature and complaining.In advertising, the pie stays the same. The industry has consistently accounted for roughly 1.3% of U.S. GDP. Which means a couple things: 1) There’s always demand, and 2) it’s a zero-sum game. As with foreign exchange, every increase is met with a commensurate decrease somewhere else.So if the money isn’t going to Facebook, where is it going? The phantom menace here is likely TikTok. Last quarter (the same quarter Google, Meta, and Snap got crushed), TikTok was the highest-grossing app for the fourth consecutive quarter — meanwhile, the rest of the app market declined. It was also the most downloaded app on the App Store, and more than a quarter of Americans under 30 now get their news from it. TikTok’s global ad revenue will triple this year, to $12 billion, which would best the revenue of Snap and Twitter combined. That number doesn’t include Douyin, TikTok’s China-based counterpart. ByteDance, the parent company that houses these assets, was recently valued at $300 billion. That’s roughly equal to Meta, Snap, and Twitter (at Elon’s inflated price) combined.TikTok’s growing influence is well documented. We’ve discussed it many times before. Less discussed is the extent to which Xi and Cook have formed an unspoken alliance to repel the advance of Meta. The company is in full-blown retreat. After Facebook and Instagram ads became less effective, ad buyers overwhelmingly turned to TikTok. Standard practice, according to one ad firm, was to move 10% to 15% of ad spend from Facebook to TikTok. The data is opaque (part and parcel of ByteDance being China-owned), but the trend is clear: TikTok is becoming the premier ad platform.You’d think TikTok would be just as susceptible to Apple’s privacy change as Facebook. After all, TikTok’s ads are fueled by an algorithm, which is fed with your data. But research suggests TikTok is more insulated against Apple’s privacy change than others. According to cybersecurity experts, TikTok can circumvent Apple’s code audits and track activity without the user’s knowledge. Exactly how this works is (again) not so clear, and that’s the point — as one expert pointed out, “ByteDance has gone to monumental lengths to conceal the inner workings of the app.” What could go wrong?I’m on a plane as I write this, taking my sons to see the Glasgow Rangers play St. Johnstone in Perth, Scotland. We are football mad, and I want my sons to see my dad’s favorite team in a 10,000-seat stadium. I’m trying to re-create a memory my dad used to tell me about, when he and his father went to this same game — the Rangers were his team. He’d get emotional talking about that day, one of his few memories of doing something, alone, with his father.About 20 years ago, I stopped dwelling on my dad’s shortcomings, put the bullshit aside, and decided to be the son I’d like to be … full stop. The catalyst for this was his sister telling me he’d been physically abused by his father. He had never mentioned this. The idea that the person you should trust most would beat you, and the damage that must do to a young soul, is unthinkable. When I told my dad about our trip, he didn’t remember who the Rangers were. He’s 92 and struggling. As his attention and memories are disappearing, I’m riddled with questions that will likely never be answered: What planes did he repair while serving in the Royal Navy? My mom, his second wife, told me his first wife tried to kill herself after he told her he was leaving her — is this true? A difficult subject I never had the confidence to broach. All of a sudden, a ton of questions.This weekend, I will take a bunch of videos of us rooting for the Rangers and send them to my father. I’ll also send them to my sons with a voiceover. I will tell them what I know of their grandfather’s affinity for the Rangers. I’ll also tell them that I have no interest in football, but love it because they love it, and it makes me feel closer to them. And that when they were born, for the first time, I knew I had purpose. That all “this” meant something.Life is so rich,P.S. I’ll go deeper on Big Tech and the strategies that do work for it in the Business Strategy Sprint, happening Dec 5–9. Join me. Sign up here."
